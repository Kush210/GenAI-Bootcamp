 Today, we're diving into the core concepts of Docker, the technology that we shape how we build, deploy, and scale applications. It's simple, consistent, and it works everywhere. Let's start with the foundation, the Dockerfile. This is where we define the environment our application needs. We specify our base image, like node 14 alpine, carefully selecting what we need and nothing more. We choose slim variants of official images, combine commands to reduce layers, and remove build tools after compilation. These practices keep our images lean and efficient. Inside our Dockerfile, each instruction creates a new layer. These layers capture specific changes to files and their configuration. We specify the base image, install dependencies, and copy the application code. This layer structure means Docker can cache and reuse parts that don't change, speeding up builds. From these layers, we create Docker images. These are self-contained packages that include everything our application needs. The runtime, system tools, libraries, and application code all bundle together. Images are immutable. Once built, they cannot be modified, only replaced with new versions. This immutability guarantees that what we test in development runs identically in production. Now let's talk about containers. These runtime instances of our images are lightweight because they share the whole system's kernel. Yet each container maintains straight isolation through Linux kernel features. Namespaces partition system resources, like process trees and network interfaces. Cgroups provide fine-grained resource controls. Through this architecture, multiple containers can run from the same image, each with its own isolated state. For distribution, we rely on Docker registries. These repositories become the single source of truth for our images. Whether we're using Docker Hub publicly or running our private registry internally, the principle remains the same, build once, run anywhere. This solves the HO, it works on my machine problem. Data persistence in containers introduces an interesting challenge. Docker volumes provide the solution. Unlike the containers writable layer, Volumes exist independently and persist data across container life cycles. We can share them between containers and mount them to specific paths, which is good for databases, shared assets, configuration files, and any data we need to preserve. As apps grow more complex, we turn to Docker Compose. It let us define multi-container applications in a simple YAML file. With Compose, we describe our entire setup, services, networks, volumes, and keep it all under version control. It makes development straightforward. In production, we often move to container orchestrators like Kubernetes. These platforms handle the complexity of running containers at scale, automatic failover, load balancing, rolling updates, and self-healing infrastructure. They provide robust service discovery, integrated monitoring, and fine-grained access control that production deployments demand. At the heart of our interaction with Docker is the CLI. This is where we interact with Docker, building images, running containers, managing networks. The Docker daemons does the hard work in the background, making it all feel effortless. The container runtime landscape extends beyond Docker. Tools like Containerd and Podman offer specialized runtime focused purely on container execution and image management. They are particularly useful when working with orchestrators like Kubernetes. If you like our video, you might like our system design newsletter as well.
