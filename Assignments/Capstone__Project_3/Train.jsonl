Eligibility for discounts can depend on several factors, such as your policy type, payment method, and any safety features you may have. For example, you could receive discounts for bundling multiple policies, setting up automatic payments, or having a good driving record. These discounts are usually applied automatically to your premium once you qualify, and you\u2019ll see the updated amount on your next billing statement.
