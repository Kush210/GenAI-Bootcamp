It manages various fan controls, including the RPM of a brushless DC (BLDC) fan motor, airflow direction (in/out and optionally up/down, left/right), flow sensor measurements (liters per minute), and electrical heater settings from 0% to 100%. When controlling an HVAC system, the actuator may incorporate additional sensors and outputs for enhanced control, such as the RPM of a BLDC compressor motor and a compressor pressure sensor. A user interface, through capacitive touch, push buttons, or an LCD, displays local values and allows data entry. A more advanced GUI can be accessed via a master actuator, IP gateway, or smartphone. A real-time clock (RTC) can be integrated to switch between operation modes based on the day, time, or holidays, with synchronization across the system.System Benefits​:Bluetooth® 5 Mesh communication enables secure bi-directional packet data flow with other sensors and actuators.Operates with low power consumption, achieving microampere-level averages while maintaining connectivity.Eliminates the need for additional wiring, simplifying installation and reducing costs.Features automatic routing without the need for setup, enhancing ease of use.Offers scalable speed versus range, providing flexibility for extended range or increased speed depending on location.Supports power supply options from building control systems, including 230VAC, 110VAC, or 24VDC.\n",

It collects data from indoor and outdoor sensor units, as well as slave actuator units, and can gather weather information from the internet if an IP gateway is implemented. Using algorithms or advanced embedded AI technology, the unit calculates and determines set points for each slave actuator, such as flow direction and temperature. These set points are provided to each slave actuator and the master unit, featuring a local graphical user interface (GUI) that can be mirrored via Bluetooth® or a web interface.Additionally, it manages a real-time clock (RTC) to synchronize operation modes based on day, time, or holidays across the system. From a system perspective, the master and slave actuators can share the same hardware and software, with the master functioning as a role rather than a specific device. This design prevents a single point of failure, allowing another slave actuator to assume the master role if needed, though only one master can be active in the system at any time.System Benefits​:The MCU enables Bluetooth 5 mesh communication​ for seamless connectivity with other devices.The master actuator can optionally include an integrated gateway for intranet/internet access, using secure communication protocols such as HTTPS or MQTT.Supports multiple connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), Thread or Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4), Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), LTE-M/NB-IoT, and LoRaWAN®, depending on regional availability and requirements.\n",

Consequently, future electricity meters will require reliable bidirectional communication paths to address these needs. The solutions that will be chosen will depend on local circumstances and will be either wired or wireless. Although the solution presented addresses a 1-Ph shunt E-Meter, the same principles of operation are applicable to current transformer and Rogowski-coil based sensing approaches with the intrinsic isolation provided by the inductive.System Benefits:As an alternative to the suggested intelligent analog front-end, the RL78/I1C microcontroller (MCU), the final solution may use the cost-effective RL78/I1B MCU, a design variant of the I1C without hardware encryption; both devices integrate a 24-bit Sigma–Delta (ΣΔ) ADC.The calculated energy parameters will be digitized and transferred via UART to the application's controller through an optical isolator. Depending on the number of lines, the serial interface is based on “n” number of isolators that may be needed.The selected applications controller is an Arm® Cortex®-M4 device with 512kB flash and 256kB RAM.The suggested LED/IrDA and RS-485 interfaces address the capability of bidirectional serial connectivity in production and/or out in the field.For remote rural deployments with poor grid quality, 2G or 5G wireless connectivity is a must.The suggested mechanical switch is a common approach to detect tamper approaches, triggering a register flag upon case opening.For urban deployments, either Sub-1-GHz communication via a data logger or wired connectivity via power line communication (PLC) is a must; while the RAA604S00 supports a proprietary frequency-shift keying (FSK) or the Wi-SUN protocol, the R9A06G037 as well as the following line driver support both the 3G-PLC and PRIME specification.The PS2561FL optical isolator is a good choice for a device that complies with the G3 requirement of zero-crossing detection, which is required for both non-isolated and isolated coupling designs.The wireless module’s nominal voltage is specified at 3.8V (min 3.3V). The supply will have to be supplied separately through its own DC/DC buck; yet, whether this system will have to be galvanically isolated from the rest of the system is a matter of discussion and cost.The rest of the system (except metrology) can be supplied through a similar, separate DC/DC buck, as the other component’s nominal supply voltages are typically at 3.3V.To guarantee galvanic isolation through the complete signal path, the metrology’s power will have to be supplied through a separate LDO; alternatively, an additional LDO could be used to power the RS-485 modem.\n",
