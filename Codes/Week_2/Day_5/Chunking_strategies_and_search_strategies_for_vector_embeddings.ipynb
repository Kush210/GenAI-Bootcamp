            "(Delivered in London, 17th November 1896)\n",
            "In the Chhâdogya Upanishad we read that a sage called Nârada came to\n",
            "another called Sanatkumâra, and asked him various questions, of which one\n",
            "was, if religion was the cause of things as they are. And Sanatkumara leads\n",
            "him, as it were, step by step, telling him that there is something higher than this\n",
            "earth, and something higher than that, and so on, till he comes to Âkâsha, ether. Ether is higher than light, because in the ether are the sun and the moon,\n",
            "lightning and the stars; in ether we live, and in ether we die. Then the question\n",
            "arises, if there is anything higher than that, and Sanatkumara tells him of Prâna. This Prana, according to the Vedanta, is the principle of life. It is like ether, an\n",
            "omnipresent principle; and all motion, either in the body or anywhere else, is\n",
            "the work of this Prana. It is greater than Akasha, and through it everything\n",
            "lives. Prana is in the mother, in the father, in the sister, in the teacher, Prana is\n",
            "the knower. I will read another passage, where Shvetaketu asks his father about the\n",
            "Truth, and the father teaches him different things, and concludes by saying,\n",
            "“That which is the fine cause in all these things, of It are all these things made. That is the All, that is Truth, thou art That, O Shvetaketu.” And then he gives\n",
            "various examples. “As a bee, O Shvetaketu, gathers honey from different\n",
            "flowers, and as the different honeys do not know that they are from various\n",
            "trees, and from various flowers, so all of us, having come to that Existence,\n",
            "know not that we have done so. Now, that which is that subtle essence, in It all\n",
            "\n",
            "\fthat exists has its self. It is the True. It is the Self and thou, O Shvetaketu, are\n",
            "That.” He gives another example of the rivers running down to the ocean. “As\n",
            "the rivers, when they are in the ocean, do not know that they have been various\n",
            "rivers, even so when we come out of that Existence, we do not know that we\n",
            "are That. O Shvetaketu, thou art That.” So on he goes with his teachings. Now there are two principles of knowledge. The one principle is that we\n",
            "know by referring the particular to the general, and the general to the\n",
            "universal; and the second is that anything of which the explanation is sought is\n",
            "to be explained so far as possible from its own nature. Taking up the first\n",
            "principle, we see that all our knowledge really consists of classifications,\n",
            "going higher and higher. When something happens singly, we are, as it were,\n",
            "dissatisfied. When it can be shown that the same thing happens again and again,\n",
            "we are satisfied and call it law. When we find that one apple falls, we are\n",
            "dissatisfied; but when we find that all apples fall, we call it the law of\n",
            "gravitation and are satisfied. The fact is that from the particular we deduce the\n",
            "general. When we want to study religion, we should apply this scientific process. The\n",
            "same principle also holds good here, and as a fact we find that that has been the\n",
            "method all through. In reading these books from which I have been translating\n",
            "to you, the earliest idea that I can trace is this principle of going from the\n",
            "particular to the general. We see how the “bright ones” became merged into\n",
            "one principle; and likewise in the ideas of the cosmos we find the ancient\n",
            "thinkers going higher and higher — from the fine elements they go to finer\n",
            "and more embracing elements, and from these particulars they come to one\n",
            "omnipresent ether, and from that even they go to an all embracing force, or\n",
            "Prana; and through all this runs the principle, that one is not separate from the\n",
            "others. It is the very ether that exists in the higher form of Prana, or the higher\n",
            "form of Prana concretes, so to say, and becomes ether; and that ether becomes\n",
            "still grosser, and so on. The generalization of the Personal God is another case in point. We have\n",
            "seen how this generalization was reached, and was called the sum total of all\n",
            "consciousness. But a difficulty arises — it is an incomplete generalization. We\n",
            "take up only one side of the facts of nature, the fact of consciousness, and upon\n",
            "that we generalise, but the other side is left out. So, in the first place it is a\n",
            "defective generalization. There is another insufficiency, and that relates to the\n",
            "second principle. Everything should be explained from its own nature. There\n",
            "may have been people who thought that every apple that fell to the ground was\n",
            "\n",
            "\fdragged down by a ghost, but the explanation is the law of gravitation; and\n",
            "although we know it is not a perfect explanation, yet it is much better than the\n",
            "other, because it is derived from the nature of the thing itself, while the other\n",
            "posits an extraneous cause. So throughout the whole range of our knowledge;\n",
            "the explanation which is based upon the nature of the thing itself is a scientific\n",
            "explanation, and an explanation which brings in an outside agent is\n",
            "unscientific. So the explanation of a Personal God as the creator of the universe has to\n",
            "stand that test. If that God is outside of nature, having nothing to do with nature,\n",
            "and this nature is the outcome of the command of that God and produced from\n",
            "nothing, it is a very unscientific theory, and this has been the weak point of\n",
            "every Theistic religion throughout the ages. These two defects we find in what\n",
            "is generally called the theory of monotheism, the theory of a Personal God,\n",
            "with all the qualities of a human being multiplied very much, who, by His will,\n",
            "created this universe out of nothing and yet is separate from it. This leads us\n",
            "into two difficulties. As we have seen, it is not a sufficient generalization, and secondly, it is not\n",
            "an explanation of nature from nature. It holds that the effect is not the cause,\n",
            "that the cause is entirely separate from the effect. Yet all human knowledge\n",
            "shows that the effect is but the cause in another form. To this idea the\n",
            "discoveries of modern science are tending every day, and the latest theory that\n",
            "has been accepted on all sides is the theory of evolution, the principle of which\n",
            "is that the effect is but the cause in another form, a readjustment of the cause,\n",
            "and the cause takes the form of the effect. The theory of creation out of nothing\n",
            "would be laughed at by modern scientists. Now, can religion stand these tests? If there be any religious theories which\n",

            "another called Sanatkumâra, and asked him various questions, of which one\n",
            "was, if religion was the cause of things as they are. And Sanatkumara leads\n",

            "arises, if there is anything higher than that, and Sanatkumara tells him of Prâna. This Prana, according to the Vedanta, is the principle of life. It is like ether, an\n",
            "omnipresent principle; and all motion, either in the body or anywhere else, is\n",

            "“That which is the fine cause in all these things, of It are all these things made. That is the All, that is Truth, thou art That, O Shvetaketu.” And then he gives\n",
