        "### Differential Association\n",
        "\n",
        "**Objective**: The purpose of computing differential association is to measure how strongly a word `w` is associated with two different sets of words, `X` and `Y`. The differential association quantifies whether a given word `w` is more closely related to the words in set `X` or the words in set `Y`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How It Is Calculated:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Similarity Measure**:\n",
        "   - A similarity measure is used to assess how similar two words are based on their embeddings (vectors). It gives a value between -1 (completely opposite) and 1 (completely similar). We use this measure to assess the similarity between the word `w` and other words in the sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **For a given word `w`**:\n",
        "   - We compute its similarity with each word in set `X` and each word in set `Y`. These sets represent different categories or groups of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Computing `sim_X`**:\n",
        "   - `sim_X` is the average similarity between the word `w` and all the words in set `X`. This means we compute the similarity between `w` and every word in `X`, and then take the mean of these similarities.\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Computing `sim_Y`**:\n",
        "   - Similarly, `sim_Y` is the average similarity between the word `w` and all the words in set `Y`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Differential Association**:\n",
        "   - The differential association for word `w` is calculated by subtracting `sim_Y` from `sim_X`. This gives us the difference in associations:\n",
        "     - **If `sim_X > sim_Y`**: The word `w` is more closely associated with the words in set `X`.\n",
        "     - **If `sim_Y > sim_X`**: The word `w` is more closely associated with the words in set `Y`.\n",
        "     - **If `sim_X = sim_Y`**: The word `w` has an equal association with both sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Mathematical Formula:\n",
        "```\n",
        "differential_association(w) = sim_X(w) - sim_Y(w)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- `sim_X(w)` is the average similarity between word `w` and each word in set `X`.\n",
        "- `sim_Y(w)` is the average similarity between word `w` and each word in set `Y`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's assume we have the following sets of words:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `X = ['artist', 'painter', 'sculptor']` (creative professions)\n",
        "- `Y = ['chef', 'baker', 'cook']` (cooking professions)\n",
        "- `w = 'man'` (attribute word)\n",
        "\n",
        "We calculate the similarity between `w = 'man'` and each word in `X`, then take the average to get `sim_X`. Similarly, we compute the similarity between `w = 'man'` and each word in `Y`, and calculate `sim_Y`. Finally, we compute the difference `sim_X - sim_Y` to get the differential association.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Interpretation:\n",
        "- If the result is positive, it means the word `w` (e.g., 'man') is more associated with the words in set `X` (e.g., 'artist', 'painter', 'sculptor').\n",
        "- If the result is negative, the word `w` is more associated with set `Y` (e.g., 'chef', 'baker', 'cook').\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Implications:\n",
        "- The score reflects potential biases in the embeddings, which can have real-world consequences in NLP applications."
