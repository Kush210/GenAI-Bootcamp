        "question": "Accidents do happen in our life. What are the deeper causes for such mishaps? Can the accidents be prevented? If yes, how?",
        "answer": "Outwardly there are many causes, but there is a deeper cause which is always there. I said the other day that if the nervous envelope is intact, accidents can be avoided, and even if there is an accident it won\u2019t have any consequences. As soon as there is a scratch or a defect in the nervous envelope of the being and according to the nature of this scratch, if one may say so, its place, its character, there will be an accident which will correspond to the diminution of resistance in the envelope. I believe almost everybody is psychologically aware of one thing: that accidents occur when one has a sort of uncomfortable feeling, when one is not fully conscious and self-possessed, when one feels uneasy. In any case, generally, people have a feeling that they are not fully themselves, not fully aware of what they are doing. If one were fully conscious, the consciousness wide awake, accidents would not occur; one would make just the right gesture, the necessary movement to avoid the accident."

    {
        "question": "Why or how is it that some persons seem to come out unhurt, even without a scratch, from major accidents, while for others, even the slightest thing turns into something very serious? Is it all a play of chance or is there something behind of which we are not usually aware but which is the determining factor?",
        "answer": "There is an accident. For instance, one slips and falls. Just between the moment one has slipped and the moment one falls there is a fraction of a second. At that moment one has the choice: it may be nothing much, it may be very serious. Only, the consciousness must naturally be wide awake and one must be in contact with one's psychic being constantly."

        "question": "How to overcome the undercurrent of restlessness and agitation within us and act from creative silence?",
        "answer": "Agitation and restlessness lead to waste and dilution of creative energy. Overcoming this requires stepping back into quiet regions, perceiving the illusion of action, and acting from a place of peace and silence."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the illusion of action?",
        "answer": "The illusion of action is the belief that constant movement and activity lead to change. In reality, it is like beating water in a cup\u2014movement without change. This illusion hinders progress and is driven by forces that do not have the best quality."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can true action be achieved?",
        "answer": "True action flows from silence. It is achieved by those who can stand outside action in silence, becoming instruments of the Divine Power. True building occurs in peace, silence, and quietness, not through restless activity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the relationship between speaking and silence?",
        "answer": "To speak usefully for ten minutes, one should remain silent for ten days. This silence refers to inner quietude, allowing one to act without being identified with the action, rising above temporal motions into the consciousness of Eternity."

    {
        "question": "What are signs of weakness according to the text?",
        "answer": "Agitation, violence, anger, and being carried away in speech are signs of weakness. They indicate mental and vital weakness, whereas true strength allows one to remain unaffected by insults and stupidity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the first sign of the divine presence in a being?",
        "answer": "The first sign of the divine presence in a being is peace. True spiritual forces act in quietness, peace, and silence, while agitation and excitement come from adverse influences."

        "question": "What is the source of the red flame of violence within us and how to overcome it?",
        "answer": "All these movements come from outside, from the universal lower Nature, or are suggested or thrown upon you by adverse forces\u2014adverse to your spiritual progress. Your method of taking them as your own is again a wrong method; for by doing that you increase their power to recur and take hold of you. If you take them as your own, that gives them a kind of right to be there. If you feel them as not your own, then they have no right, and the will can develop more power to send them away. What you must always have and feel as yours is this will, the power to refuse assent, to refuse admission to a wrong movement. Or if it comes in, the power to send it away, without expressing it. [SABCL, 24:1410]"

    {
        "question": "How to master anger?",
        "answer": "If you have a serious difficulty in your character, for example, the habit of losing your temper, and you decide: \u201cI must not get angry again\u201d, it is very difficult, but if on the other hand, you tell yourself: \u201cAnger is something which circulates through the whole world, it is not in me, it belongs to everybody; it wanders about here and there and if I close my door, it will not enter\u201d, it is much more easy. If you think: \u201cIt is my character, I am born like that\u201d, it becomes almost impossible. It is true there is something in your character which answers to this force of anger. All movements, all vibrations are general\u2014they enter, they go out, they move about\u2014but they rush upon you and enter into you only to the extent you leave the door in you open. And if you have, besides, some affinity with these forces, you may get angry without even knowing why. Everything is everywhere and it is arbitrary to draw limits. [CWM2, 4:170]"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the first step towards weakening the power of anger?",
        "answer": "If you give expression to anger, you prolong or confirm the habit of the recurrence of anger; you do not diminish or get rid of the habit. The very first step towards weakening the power of anger in the nature and afterwards getting rid of it altogether is to refuse all expression to it in act or speech. Afterwards one can go on with more likelihood of success to throw it out from the thought and feeling also."

    {
        "question": "How can one observe anger without identifying with it?",
        "answer": "Look at it and see how trifling is the occasion of the rising of this anger and its outburst\u2014it becomes more and more causeless\u2014and the absurdity of such movements itself. It would not really be difficult to get rid of it if, when it comes, you looked at it calmly\u2014for it is perfectly possible to stand back in one part of the being, observing in a detached equanimity even while the anger rises on the surface\u2014as if it were someone else in your being who had the anger. The difficulty is that you get alarmed and upset and that makes it easier for the thing to get hold of your mind which it should not do."

        "question": "What are some practical suggestions for dealing with anger?",
        "answer": "If one takes as an absolute discipline, instead of acting or speaking (because speech is an action), instead of acting under the impulse, if one withdraws and then does as I said, one sits down quietly, concentrates and then looks at his anger quietly, one writes it down, when one has finished writing, it is gone\u2014in any case, most often. [CWM2, 7:106] And there is a very small superficial application of this which perhaps you will understand. Someone comes and insults you or says unpleasant things to you; and if you begin to vibrate in unison with this anger or this ill-will, you feel quite weak and powerless and usually you make a fool of yourself. But if you manage to keep within yourself, especially in your head, a complete immobility which refuses to receive these vibrations, then at the same time you feel a great strength, and the other person cannot disturb you. If you remain very quiet, even physically, and when violence is directed at you, you are able to remain very quiet, very silent, very still, well, that has a power not only over you but over the other person also. If you don\u2019t have all these vibrations of inner response, if you can remain absolutely immobile within yourself, everywhere, this has an almost immediate effect upon the other person.

        "question": "What is the meaning of true art? Is it just music and painting? Does it have any practical significance for our life?",
        "answer": "Art is the human language of the nervous plane, intended to express and communicate the Divine, who in the domain of sensation manifests as beauty. The purpose of art is therefore to give those for whom it is meant a freer and more perfect communion with the Supreme Reality. The first contact with this Supreme Reality expresses itself in our consciousness by a flowering of the being in a plenitude of vast and peaceful delight. Each time that art can give the spectator this contact with the infinite, however fleetingly, it fulfils its aim; it has shown itself worthy of its mission. Thus no art which has for many centuries moved and delighted a people can be dismissed, since it has at least partially fulfilled its mission\u2014to be the powerful and more or less perfect utterance of that which is to be expressed. [CWM2, 2:123\u201324]"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is true art?",
        "answer": "True art is the beautiful, but in close intimacy with the universal movement. The greatest nations and the most cultured races have always considered art as a part of life and made it subservient to life. Art was like that in Japan in its best moments; it was like that in all the best moments in the history of art. But most artists are like parasites growing on the margin of life; they do not seem to know that art should be the expression of the Divine in life and through life. In everything, everywhere, in all relations truth must be brought out in its all-embracing rhythm and every movement of life should be an expression of beauty and harmony. Skill is not art, talent is not art. Art is a living harmony and beauty that must be expressed in all the movements of existence. This manifestation of beauty and harmony is part of the Divine realisation upon earth, perhaps even its greatest part. [CWM2, 3:108]"

        "question": "How to ignite the psychic fire in the heart?",
        "answer": "By aspiration. By the will for progress, by the urge towards perfection. Above all, it is the will for progress and self-purification which lights the fire. The will for progress. Those who have a strong will, when they turn it towards spiritual progress and purification, automatically light the fire within themselves. And each defect one wants to cure or each progress one wants to make\u2015if all that is thrown into the fire, it burns with a new intensity. And this is not an image, it is a fact in the subtle physical. One can feel the warmth of the flame, one can see in the subtle physical the light of the flame. And when there is something in the nature which prevents one from advancing and one throws it into this fire, it begins to burn and the flame becomes more intense. (CWM, Vol. 8, p251)"

        "question": "Is Astrology a science or a superstition? What is the relationship between stars and fate? Does our horoscope determine our fate?",
        "answer": "Astrology has never been scientifically disproved, nor has any rational ground ever been advanced for treating it as a pseudo-science. It was assumed to be a superstition due to intellectual influences at a certain period. The belief that planets cannot influence our lives is not a sufficient ground to dismiss astrology. Just as there have been quacks in medicine, the presence of charlatans in astrology does not invalidate the underlying truth of the science. The failure of predictions does not disprove astrology, just as the failure of doctors does not disprove medicine."

        "question": "How to use the torch of attention?",
        "answer": "It is exactly as though you had what is called \u201ca torchlight\u201d, a small beacon-light in your head at the place of observation. Scientists who want to do a certain work turn the beacon in a particular way, they always put it there and the beacon remains thus: they turn it towards matter, towards the details of matter. But people with imagination turn it upward, because up above there is everything, you know, all inspirations of artistic and literary things: this comes from another domain. It comes from a much more subtle domain, much less material. So these turn upward and want to receive the light from above. But it is the same instrument. The others turn it downwards, and it is just a lack of gymnastic skill. It is the same instrument. It is the same power of a luminous ray upon something. But as one has made it a habit of concentrating it in a certain direction, one is no longer supple, one loses the habit of doing things otherwise. But you can at any time do both the things. When you are doing science, you turn it in one direction and when you do literature and art, you turn it in the other direction; but it is the same instrument: all depends on the orientation. If you have concentration, you can move this power of concentration from one place to another and in every way it will be effective. If you are occupied with science, you use it in a scientific way, and if you want to do art, you use it in an artistic way. But it is the same instrument and it is the same power of concentration. It is simply because people do not know this that they limit themselves. So the hinges get rusty, they do not turn any more. Otherwise, if one keeps the habit of turning them, they continue to turn. Moreover, even from the ordinary point of view, it is not rare to find a scientist having as his hobby some artistic occupation\u2014and the reverse also. It is because they have found that the one was not harmful to the other and that it was the same faculty which could be utilised in both. Essentially, from the general point of view, particularly from the intellectual viewpoint, the most important thing is the capacity of attention and concentration, it is that which one must work at and develop. From the point of view of action (physical action), it is the will: you must work and build up an unshakable will. From the intellectual point of view, you must work and build up a power of concentration which nothing can shake. And if you have both, concentration and will, you will be a genius and nothing will resist you."

        "answer": "Beauty is the divine language in forms. It is the special divine Manifestation in the physical as Truth is in the mind, Love in the heart, Power in the vital. Supramental beauty is the highest divine beauty manifesting in Matter.

        "question": "How to become conscious of the central will in our being?",
        "answer": "First of all one must become aware of what is highest, most true, most universal and eternal in one\u2019s consciousness. This is learnt gradually. One learns to discern among one\u2019s ordinary, external movements and the different gradations of the movements of one\u2019s inner consciousness. And if one continues to do this with a certain persistence, one realises what it is that puts this highest part of one\u2019s being into motion, which represents the ideal of the being. There is no other way. Sometimes this awake through reading something, sometimes through a conversation, sometimes through a more or less dramatic, that is, unexpected event, which gives you a shock, shakes you up, brings you out of your usual little rut. Sometimes when you are in very great danger, suddenly you feel as though you are above yourself and beyond your small habitual weakness, having within you something higher which can hold out against circumstances. Such occasions make you enter, first, into contact with that. Afterwards by a methodical discipline you can make the contact continuous; but usually this takes time. But first you get it like that, suddenly, for one reason or another. (Long silence) This may come with a very strong emotion, with a very great sorrow, a very great enthusiasm. When one is called to perform a fairly exceptional action, in circumstances which are a little exceptional, all of a sudden, one feels something as though breaking or opening within him, and one feels as though he were dominating himself, as though he had climbed up a higher rung and from there was looking at his own existence with the habitual sees. Once one has experienced this, one does not forget; even if only once it has happened, one does not forget it. And one can by concentration reproduce the state at will, later. This is the first step to cultivate it. Afterwards one can very easily call up this state each time a decision is to be taken, and then one takes it in full awareness of the implications and foreseeing everything that\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s one individual in the world who hasn\u2019t experienced it\u2014in any case one cultured individual\u2014at least once in his life, something that breaks and opens\u2026 and one understands.

        "question": "How to get beyond blaming yourself and move forward?",
        "answer": "Blaming oneself? No, not necessarily. It may be useful, it is indeed useful from time to time in order to get out of the illusion of one\u2019s own perfection. But one wastes much energy in self-criticism. It is much better to use this same energy in making progress, a concrete progress, something more useful. For example, if you have thoughts which are unpleasant, ugly, vulgar and disturbing, and you say, \u201cAh, ah, how intolerable I am, I still have such thoughts, what a nuisance it is!\u201d, it would be much better to use this very energy simply to do this (gesture) and drive away the thoughts.\n\nAnd this is only the first step. The second is to try to have other thoughts, to take interest in something else: either read or reflect, but in any case try to fill your mind with something more interesting, to use your energy in constructing rather than in destroying.\n\nIt is of course necessary from time to time to recognise one\u2019s faults; it is altogether indispensable. But to dwell too much upon them is not necessary. What is necessary is to use all one\u2019s energy in order to build up the qualities one wants to have and do what one wants to do. This is much more important."

        "question": "How does a true book of knowledge act?",
        "answer": "There is one thing certain about the mind and its workings; it is that you can understand only what you already know in your own inner self. What strikes you in a book is what you have already experienced deep within you. Men find a book or a teaching very wonderful and often you hear them say, \u201cThat is exactly what I myself feel and know, but I could not bring it out or express it as well as it is expressed here.\u201d When men come across a book of true knowledge, each finds himself there, and at every new reading he discovers things that he did not see in it at first; it opens to him each time a new field of knowledge that had till then escaped him in it. But that is because it reaches layers of knowledge that were waiting for expression in the subconscious in him; the expression has now been given by somebody else and much better than he could himself have done it. But, once expressed, he immediately recognises it and feels that it is the truth. The knowledge that seems to come to you from outside is only an occasion for bringing out the knowledge that is within you. (CWM, Vol. 3, p51-52)"

        "answer": "When one is bored, Mother, does that mean one does not progress? At that time, yes, certainly without a doubt; not only does one not progress, but one misses an opportunity for progressing. There was a concurrence of circumstances which seemed to you dull, boring, stupid and you were in their midst; well, if you get bored, it means that you yourself are as boring as the circumstances! And that is a clear proof that you are simply not in a state of progress. There is nothing more contrary to the very reason of existence than this passing wave of boredom. If you make a little effort within yourself at that time, if you tell yourself: \u201cWait a bit, what is it that I should learn? What does all that bring to me so that I may learn something? What progress should I make in overcoming myself? What is the weakness that I must overcome? What is the inertia that I must conquer?\u201d If you say that to yourself, you will see the next minute you are no longer bored. You will immediately get interested and you will make progress! This is a commonplace of consciousness. (CWM, Vol. 5, p50)"

        "question": "Can business be done with higher ideals beyond making money? Is doing business incompatible with spiritual life?",
        "answer": "The traditional religious conception views money-making and God-seeking as incompatible pursuits. But in this letter to a disciple, Sri Aurobindo explains that in an integral spiritual perspective, spiritual growth does not depend so much on the outer act but on the inner attitude. He does not regard business as something evil or tainted. All depends on the spirit in which a thing is done, the principles on which it is built, and the use to which it is turned. It is possible for a man to do business and make money and earn profits and yet be a spiritual man, practice yoga, and have an inner life. The Gita justifies works as a means of spiritual salvation and enjoins a Yoga of Works as well as of Bhakti and Knowledge."

        "answer": "This is not correct. If one produces something, instead of an impoverishment, it is an enrichment; simply one puts into circulation in the world something else having a value equivalent to that of money. However, in affairs of pure speculation, such as on the Stock Exchange or in finance, it is true that financial success can be detrimental to another.

        "question": "How to change our character?",
        "answer": "The difficulties of the character persist so long as one yields to them in action when they rise. One has to make a strict rule not to act according to the impulses of anger, ego or whatever the weakness may be that one wants to get rid of, or if one does act in the heat of the moment, not to justify or persist in the action. If one does that, after a time the difficulty abates or is confined purely to a subjective movement which one can observe, detach oneself from and combat. (CWSA, Vol. 31, p706) First of all one must be conscious, then control, and by continuing the mastery one changes one\u2019s character. Changing the character is what comes last. One must control bad habits, the old habits, for a very long time for them to drop off and the character to change. We may take the example of someone who has frequent depressions. When things are not exactly as he would like them to be, he becomes depressed. So, to begin with, he must become aware of his depression\u2014not only of the depression but of the causes of depression, why he gets depressed so easily. Then, once he has become conscious, he must master the depressions, must stop being depressed even when the cause of depression is there\u2014he must master his depression, stop it from coming. And finally, after this work has been done for a sufficiently long time, the nature loses the habit of having depressions and no longer reacts in the same way, the nature is changed.

You may refuse to use it (as most people do), but it is a mass to be transformed that is there in your hands, fully at your disposal, given to you so that you may learn to work upon it. So, the most important thing is to begin by doing that. You can do nothing for others unless you are able to do it for yourself. You can never give a good advice to anyone unless you are able to give it to yourself first, and to follow it. And if you see a difficulty somewhere, the best way of changing this difficulty is to change it in yourself first. If you see a defect in anyone, you may be sure it is in you, and you begin to change it in yourself. And when you will have changed it in yourself, you will be strong enough to change it in others. And this is a wonderful thing, people don\u2019t realise what an infinite grace it is that this universe is arranged in such a way that there is a collection of substance, from the most material to the highest spiritual, all that gathered together into what is called a small individual, but at the disposal of a central Will. And that is yours, your field of work, nobody can take it away from you, it is your own property. And to the extent you can work upon it, you will be able to have an action upon the world. But only to that extent. One must do more for oneself, besides, than one does for others."

        "question": "We tend to be disturbed or overwhelmed by circumstances. Is it a necessity or a habit which can be overcome? Is it possible to remain inwardly calm and undisturbed under all circumstances?",
        "answer": "It is an error or superstition to believe that an external thing or circumstance can be the cause of anything. All things and circumstances are the accompanying results of a Force that acts from behind the veil. The Force acts and each thing reacts according to its own nature. One must not take consequences for causes. Never take physical happenings at their face value. They are always a clumsy attempt to express something else, the true thing which escapes your superficial understanding. Do not mind the apparent contradictions. There is a truth to be found behind.

People keep lamenting about their lot and feel that their troubles and their unhappy reactions would go if other people and things were changed. Each one is the artisan of his own miseries. It is always a mistake to complain about the circumstances of our life, for they are the outward expression of what we are ourselves. [CWM2, 14: 214]"

If somebody is a \u201cnervous wreck\u201d, he thinks that if circumstances are favourable he will improve. But, actually, even if they are favourable he will remain what he is.

        "answer": "Compassion is the equivalent of _mis\u00e9ricorde_. It is a pity full of strength and kindness, a pity that pardons and makes amends, forgets all offences and wants always what is best for everyone.

        "answer": "The compassion of a divine soul overlooks men, embracing all other souls in himself, not the shrinking of the heart and the nerves and the flesh which is the ordinary human form of pity: nor does he attach a supreme importance to the life of the body, but looks beyond to the life of the soul and attaches to the other only an instrumental value."

        "answer": "Compassion and gratitude are essentially psychic virtues. They appear in the consciousness only when the psychic being takes part in active life. The vital and the physical experience them as weaknesses, for they curb the free expression of their impulses, which are based on the power of strength."

Yet there is an element of truth in the conception of the unfeeling superman: it is this, that the higher race will not feel the kind of egoistic, weak and sentimental pity which men call charity. This pity, which does more harm than good, will be replaced by a strong and enlightened compassion whose only purpose will be to provide a true remedy to suffering, not to perpetuate it."

The Divine Grace came to aid the persecutor (Saul of Tarsus), it came to St. Augustine the profligate, to Jagai and Madhai of infamous fame, to Bilwamangal and many others whose conversion might well scandalise the puritanism of the human moral intelligence; but it can come to the righteous also\u2014curing them of their self-righteousness and leading to a purer consciousness beyond these things."

The consequences of a wrong and low movement\u2014instead of throwing it back with cold justice upon the one who has committed the mistake, it absorbs it, in order to transform it within itself, and diminishes as far as possible the material consequences of the fault committed."

        "answer": "Self-pity is always born of self-love; but pity for others is not always born of love for its object. It is sometimes a self-regarding shrinking from the sight of pain; sometimes the rich man\u2019s contemptuous dole to the pauper. Develop rather God\u2019s divine compassion than human pity. Not pity that bites the heart and weakens the inner members, but a divine masterful and untroubled compassion and helpfulness is the virtue that we should encourage."

        "answer": "It is from a state of deep compassion that the Divine acts in Matter and this deep compassion is translated in Matter precisely by this psychic sorrow which is spoken about here. The Divine\u2019s state of compassion is translated in the psychic consciousness by a sorrow that is not egoistic, a sorrow that is the expression of the identification through sympathy with universal sorrow."

        "answer": "Even when one weeps over another\u2019s misery, there is always a mixture. There is a mixture, but as soon as the psychic gets mingled in the sorrow, there is an element of 'compassion in reverse' which comes into the being and, if one can disentangle the two, concentrate upon that, come out of one\u2019s ego and unite with this compassion in reverse, through this one can come into contact with the great universal Compassion which is something immense, vast, calm, powerful, deep, full of perfect peace and an infinite sweetness."

        "answer": "Whatever you may want to do in life, one thing is absolutely indispensable and at the basis of everything, the capacity of concentrating the attention. If you are able to gather together the rays of attention and consciousness on one point and can maintain this concentration with a persistent will, nothing can resist it\u2014whatever it may be, from the most material physical development to the highest spiritual one. But this discipline must be followed in a constant and, it may be said, imperturbable way; not that you should always be concentrated on the same thing \u2014that\u2019s not what I mean, I mean learning to concentrate. And materially, for studies, sports, all physical or mental development, it is absolutely indispensable. And the value of an individual is proportionate to the value of his attention. And from the spiritual point of view it is still more important. There is no spiritual obstacle which can resist a penetrating power of concentration. For instance, the discovery of the psychic being, union with the inner Divine, opening to the higher spheres, all can be obtained by an intense and obstinate power of concentration\u2014but one must learn how to do it. There is nothing in the human or even in the superhuman field, to which the power of concentration is not the key. You can be the best athlete, you can be the best student, you can be an artistic, literary or scientific genius, you can be the greatest saint with that faculty. And everyone has in himself a tiny little beginning of it\u2014it is given to everybody, but people do not cultivate it. [CWM2, 9:360]"

This confidence should persist, unshaken, throughout life; but the limited idea, ignorant and superficial, of its needs which a child has, must be replaced progressively by a wider, deeper and truer conception which culminates in the perfect conception of needs in accordance with the supreme wisdom, until we realise that the Divine alone knows what our true needs are and rely upon Him for everything.

Yes, I repeat, we lack confidence, not in what we are at the present moment, not in our ephemeral and ever-changing outer being\u2014this being always finds favour in our eyes\u2014but we lack confidence in what we can become through effort, we have no faith in the integral and profound transformation which will be the work of our true self, of the eternal, the divine who is in all beings, if we surrender like children to its supremely luminous and far-seeing guidance.

Nothing but these small things which are nothing at all and take no time. One day it will happen. Only, you must do it with concentration, intensity and sincerity; that is, it must not happen that while you are asking for this, another part of your being is telling itself, \u201cAfter all, this has no importance.\u201d Or maybe you think of something else, what you are going to put on or the[p.399] person you will meet, anything at all, a thousand desires. You must be there, fully, for one minute. Of course if you multiply the minute, it goes so much the quicker. But as I also said, if one is able not to contradict the next minute the aspiration one had the minute before, it is easier; if not, it pushes sincerity away."

    },
    {
        "question": "How to empty our consciousness of mixed content?",
        "answer": "By aspiration, the rejection of the lower movements, a call to a higher force. If you do not accept certain movements, then naturally, when they find that they can\u2019t manifest, gradually they diminish in force and stop occurring. If you refuse to express everything that is of a lower kind, little by little the very thing disappears, and the consciousness is emptied of lower things. It is by refusing to give expression\u2014I mean not only in action but also in thought, in feeling. When impulses, thoughts, emotion come, if you refuse to express them, if you push them aside and remain in a state of inner aspiration and calm, then gradually they lose their force and stop coming. So the consciousness is emptied of its lower movements.\n\nBut for instance, when undesirable thoughts come, if you look at them, observe them, if you take pleasure in following them in their movements, they will never stop coming. It is the same thing when you have undesirable feelings or sensation: if you pay attention to them, concentrate on them or even look at them with a certain indulgence, they will never stop.\n\nBut if you absolutely refuse to receive and express them, after some time they stop. You must be patient and very persistent.\n\nIn a great aspiration, if you can put yourself into contact with something higher, some influence of your psychic being or some light from above, and if you can manage to put this in touch with these lower movements, naturally they stop more quickly. But before even being able to draw these things by aspiration, you can already stop those movements from finding expression in you by a very persistent and patient refusal. When thoughts which you do not like come, if you just brush them away and do not pay them any attention at all, after some time they won\u2019t come any longer. But you must do this very persistently and regularly."
    },
    {
        "question": "How to make our consciousness vast?",
        "answer": "The easiest way is to identify yourself with something vast. For instance, when you feel that you are shut up in a completely narrow and limited thought, will, consciousness, when you feel as though you were in a shell, then if you begin thinking about something very vast, as for example, the immensity of the waters of an ocean, and if really you can think of this ocean and how it stretches out far, far, far, far, in all directions, like this (Mother stretches out her arms), how, compared with you, it is so far, so far that you cannot see the other shore, you cannot reach its end anywhere, neither behind nor in front nor to the right or left\u2026 it is wide, wide, wide, wide\u2026 you think of this and then you feel that you are floating on this sea, like that, and that there are no limits\u2026 This is very easy. Then you can widen your consciousness a little.\n\nOther people, for example, begin looking at the sky; and then they imagine all those spaces between all those stars, and all\u2026 that kind of infinity of spaces in which the earth is a tiny point, and you too are just a very tiny point, smaller than an ant, on the earth. And so you look at the sky and feel that you are floating in these infinite spaces between the planets, and that you are growing vaster and vaster to go farther and farther. Some people succeed with this.\n\nThere is a way also by trying to identify yourself with all things upon earth. For example, when you have a small narrow vision of something and are hurt by others\u2019 vision and point of view, you must begin by shifting your consciousness, try to put it in others, and try gradually to identify yourself with all the different ways of thinking of all others. This is a little more\u2026 how shall I put it?\u2026 dangerous. Because to identify oneself with the thought and will of others means to identify oneself with a heap of stupidities (Mother laughs) and bad wills, and this may bring consequences which are not very good. But still, some people do this more easily. For instance, when they are in disagreement with someone, in order to widen their consciousness they try to put themselves in the place of the other and see the thing not from their own point of view but from the point of view of the other. This wide the consciousness, though not as much as by the first ways I spoke about, which are quite innocent. They don\u2019t do you any harm, they do you much good. They make you very peaceful.\n\nThere are lots of intellectual ways of widening the consciousness. These I have explained fully in my book. But in any case, when you are bored by something, when something is painful to you or very unpleasant, if you begin to think of the eternity of time and the immensity of space, if you think of all that has gone before and all that will come afterwards, and that this second in eternity is truly just a passing breath, and that it seems so utterly ridiculous to be upset by something which in the eternity of time is\u2026 one doesn\u2019t even have the time to become aware of it, it has no place, no importance, because, what indeed is a second in eternity? If one can manage to realise that, to\u2026 how to put it?\u2026 visualise, picture the little person one is, in the little earth where one is, and the tiny second of consciousness which for the moment is hurting you or is unpleasant for you, just this\u2014 which in itself is only a second in your existence, and that you yourself have been many things before and will be many more things afterwards, that what affects you now you will have probably completely forgotten in ten years, or if you remember it you will say, \u201cHow did I happen to attach any importance to that?\u201d\u2026 if you can realise that first and then realise your little person which is a second in eternity, not even a second, you know, imperceptible, a fragment of a second in eternity, that the whole world has unrolled before this and will unroll yet, indefinitely\u2014before, behind\u2014and that\u2026 well, then suddenly you see the utter ridiculousness of the importance you attach to what happened to you\u2026 Truly you feel\u2026 to what an extent it is absurd to attach any importance to one\u2019s life, to oneself, and to what happen to you. And in the space of three minutes, if you do this properly, all unpleasantness is swept away. Even a very deep pain can be swept away. Simply a concentration like this, and to place oneself in infinity and eternity. Everything goes away. One comes out of it cleansed. One can get rid of all attachments and even, I say, of the deepest sorrows\u2014of everything, in this way\u2014if one knows how to do it in the right way. It immediately takes you out of your little ego."

        "question": "How to rise beyond disturbing movements or events like criticism by expanding our consciousness?",
        "answer": "By climbing somewhere up on the ladder\u2014in one\u2019s own consciousness\u2014looking at things a little more vastly, a little more generally. For example, if at a particular moment there is something which holds you, grips you like that, holds you tight, close pressed, and you absolutely want it to happen, and you are fighting against a terrible obstacle, you see, something which is preventing it from happening; if simply just at that moment you begin to feel, to realise the myriads and myriads of years there were before this present moment, and the myriads and myriads of years there will be after this present moment, and what importance this little event has in relation to all that\u2014there is no need to enter a spiritual consciousness or anything else, simply enter into relation with space and time, with all that is before, all that is after and all that is happening at the same time\u2014if one is not an idiot, immediately he tells himself, \u201cOh, well, I am attaching importance to something which doesn\u2019t have any.\u201d Necessarily so, you see. It loses all its importance, immediately.\n\nIf you can visualise, you know, simply the immensity of the creation\u2014I am not now speaking of rising to spiritual heights\u2014simply the immensity of the creation in time and space, and this little event on which you are concentrated with an importance\u2026 as though it were something of some importance\u2026 immediately it does this (gesture) and it dissolves, if you do it sincerely. If, naturally, there is one part of yourself which tells you, \u201cAh, but for me it has an importance\u201d, then, there, you have only to leave that part behind and keep your consciousness as it is. But if sincerely you want to see the true value of things, it is very easy.\n\nThere are other methods, you know. There is a Chinese sage who advises you to lie down upon events as one floats on one\u2019s back upon the sea, imagining the immensity of the ocean and that you let yourself go floating upon this\u2026 upon the waves, you see, like something contemplating the skies and letting itself be carried away. In Chinese they call this Wu We\u00ef When you can do this all your troubles are gone. I knew an Irishman who used to lie flat on his back and look outside, as much as possible on an evening when stars were in the sky, he looked, contemplated the sky and imagined that he was floating in that immensity of countless luminous points.\n\nAnd immediately all troubles are calmed.\n\nThere are many ways. But sincerely, you have only to\u2026 have the sense of relativity between your little person and the importance you give to the things which concern you, and the universal immensity; this is enough."

        "question": "How to expand into cosmic consciousness?",
        "answer": "How can you do it? You know what the cosmic consciousness is? You must first begin by knowing that. The cosmic consciousness means that, instead of feeling that one is an altogether separate, isolated being, different from all others, one feels that he is only a part of an immense whole and in relation with the whole totality, receiving the movements and vibrations of all others and transmitting to all others its own vibrations, that the movements of consciousness, the psychological vibrations do not stop inside a small individual enclosed in himself, who is as in a shell, without any contact with the rest; the forces pass across, going from one to another, touching one here, another there, and these forces are so complex and multiple that we can no longer tell where one begins and another ends. One has exactly the impression of an immense whole moving within itself. It is something like that\u2014the cosmic consciousness.\n\nSo, first of all, you must think of this; you must first become aware that you are a point in the universal immensity, and not isolated but altogether joined with it. And then you must study yourself, observe yourself. You will immediately have the opportunity of seeing the vibrations which come from outside and pass through you but are not generated in you, which you receive and express. So gradually, by studying, looking, observing, you become aware of that which is not limited. This is how you begin to acquire the universal or cosmic consciousness. Cosmic and universal mean the same thing.\n\n(CWM, Vol. 6, p419-420)"

Once you know that, you begin to become aware that in reality there cannot be any separation between you and something greater than you of which you are a part. This is the beginning. Now, you must come to the point not only of thinking this but of feeling it and even living it, and then the wall of ignorance tumbles: one feels this unity everywhere and realises that he is only a more or less fragmentary part of a whole much vaster than he, which is the universe. Then one begins to have a more universal consciousness.\n\n(CWM, Vol. 7, p233)"

        "answer": "Courage is the total absence of fear in any form. Integral courage means that whatever the danger, the attitude remains the same\u2014calm and assured.

True courage is facing everything in life without fear, with a constant consciousness of the divine Presence, and a total self-giving to the Divine."

        "question": "How does one master fear to be courageous?",
        "answer": "To overcome one\u2019s fear means that there is one part of the being which is stronger than the other, and which has no fear and imposes its own intrepidity on the part which is afraid. This doesn\u2019t necessarily imply that one is more courageous than the one who has no fear to master."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is courage related to aspiration?",
        "answer": "Courage means having a taste for the supreme adventure, which is aspiration. An aspiration takes hold of you completely and flings you into the great adventure of the divine discovery, meeting, and Realisation without looking back or asking what\u2019s going to happen."

    },
    {
        "question": "How to deal with the dark shadow in us?",
        "answer": "One can see, when one studies oneself very attentively\u2026. For example, if you observe yourself, you see that one day you are very generous. Let us take this, it is easy to understand. Very generous: generous in your feelings, generous in your sensations, generous in your thoughts and even in material things; that is, you understand the faults of others, their intentions, weaknesses, even nasty movements. You see all this, and you are full of good feelings, of generosity. You tell yourself, \u201cWell\u2026 everyone does the best he can!\u201d\u2014 like that.\n\nAnother day\u2014or perhaps the very next minute\u2014you will notice in yourself a kind of dryness, fixity, something that is bitter, that judges severely, that goes as far as bearing a grudge, has rancour, would like the evil-doer punished, that almost has feelings of vengeance; just the very opposite of the former! One day someone harms you and you say, \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter! He did not know\u201d\u2026 or \u201cHe couldn\u2019t do otherwise\u201d\u2026 or \u201cThat\u2019s his nature\u201d\u2026 or \u201cHe could not understand!\u201d The next day\u2014or perhaps an hour later\u2014you say, \u201cHe must be punished! He must pay for it! He must be made to feel that he has done wrong!\u201d\u2014with a kind of rage; and you want to take things, you want to keep them for yourself, you have all the feelings of jealousy, envy, narrowness, you see, just the very opposite of the other feeling.\n\nThis is the dark side. And so, the moment one sees it, if one looks at it and doesn\u2019t say, \u201cIt is I\u201d, if one says, \u201cNo, it is my shadow, it is the being I must throw out of myself\u201d, one puts on it the light of the other part, one tries to bring them face to face; and with the knowledge and light of the other, one doesn\u2019t try so much to convince\u2014because that is very difficult\u2014but one compels it to remain quiet\u2026 first to stand farther away, then one flings it very far away so that it can no longer return\u2014putting a great light on it. There are instances in which it is possible to change, but this is very rare. There are instances in which one can put upon this being\u2014or this shadow\u2014put upon it such an intense light that it transforms it, and it changes into what is the truth of your being.\n\nBut this is a rare thing\u2026It can be done, but it is rare. Usually, the best thing is to say, \u201cNo, this is not I! I don\u2019t want it! I have nothing to do with this movement, it doesn\u2019t exist for me, it is something contrary to my nature!\u201d And so, by dint of insisting and driving it away, finally one separates oneself from it.\n\nBut one must first be clear and sincere enough to see the conflict within oneself. Usually one doesn\u2019t pay any attention to these things. One goes from one extreme to the other. You see, you can say, to put it in very simple words: one day I am good, the next day I am bad. And this seems quite natural\u2026 Or even, sometimes for one hour you are good and the next hour you are wicked; or else, sometimes the whole day through one is good and suddenly one becomes wicked, for a minute very wicked, all the more wicked as one was good! Only, one doesn\u2019t observe it, thoughts cross one\u2019s mind, violent, bad, hateful things, like that\u2026 Usually one pays no attention to it. But this is what must be caught! As soon as it manifests, you must catch it like this (Mother makes a movement) with a very firm grip, and then hold it, hold it up to the light and say, \u201cNo! I\u2014don\u2019t\u2014want\u2014you! I don\u2019t want you! I have nothing to do with this! You are going to get out of here, and you won\u2019t return!\u201d"

        "question": "What are the root causes of pain and suffering and how to overcome these unpleasant facets of life?",
        "answer": "Pain and suffering are necessary results of the Ignorance in which we live; men grow by all kinds of experience, pain and suffering as well as their opposites, joy and happiness and ecstasy. One can get strength from them if one meets them in the right way. Many take a joy in pain and suffering when associated with struggle or endeavour or adventure, but that is more because of the exhilaration and excitement of the struggle than because of suffering for its own sake. There is, however, something in the vital which takes joy in the whole of life, its dark as well as its bright sides."

    {
        "question": "Why is there pain and suffering? How should we deal with them, including physical illness? What happens when we seek pleasure?",
        "answer": "Pain and grief are Nature's reminder to the soul that the pleasure it enjoys is only a feeble hint of the real delight of existence. In each pain and torture of our being is the secret of a flame of rapture compared with which our greatest pleasures are only as dim flickerings. It is this secret which forms the attraction for the soul of the great ordeals, sufferings and fierce experiences of life which the nervous mind in us shuns and abhors."

        "answer": "I have already told you many a time that to seek suffering and pain is a morbid attitude which must be avoided, but to run away from them through forgetfulness, through a superficial, frivolous movement, through diversion, is cowardice. When pain comes, it comes to teach us something. The quicker we learn it, the more the need for pain diminishes, and when we know the secret, it will no longer be possible to suffer, for that secret reveals to us the reason, the cause, the origin of suffering, and the way to pass beyond it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the secret to overcoming pain and suffering?",
        "answer": "The secret is to emerge from the ego, get out of its prison, unite ourselves with the Divine, merge into Him, not to allow anything to separate us from Him. Then, once one has discovered this secret and realises it in one\u2019s being, pain loses its justification and suffering disappears. It is an all-powerful remedy, not only in the deeper parts of the being, in the soul, in the spiritual consciousness, but also in life and in the body."

    {
        "question": "What is the central difficulty in overcoming defects in our character?",
        "answer": "Evidently there is one difficulty: in your conscious being something does not want the difficulty, wishes sincerely to overcome it, but there are numberless movements in other parts of your consciousness of which you are not conscious. You say, \u201cI want to be cured of that\u201d; unfortunately it is not sufficient to say \u201cI want\u201d, there are other parts of the consciousness which hide themselves so that you may not be busy with them, and when your attention is turned away these parts try to assert themselves. That is why I say and shall always repeat, Be perfectly sincere; do not try to deceive yourself, do not say, \u201cI have done all that I could.\u201d If you do not succeed, it means that you do not do all that you can. For, if you truly do \u201call\u201d that you can, you will surely succeed. If you have any defect which you want to get rid of and which still persists, and you say, \u201cI have done all that I could\u201d, you may be sure that you have not done all that you should have. If you had, you would have triumphed, for the difficulties that come to you are exactly in proportion to your strength\u2014nothing can happen to you which does not belong to your consciousness, and all that belongs to your consciousness you are able to master. Even the things and suggestions that come from outside can touch you only in proportion to the consent of your consciousness, and you are made to be the master of your consciousness. If you say, \u201cI have done all that I could and in spite of everything the thing continues, so I give up\u201d, you may be already sure that you have not done what you could. When an error persists \u201cin spite of everything\u201d it means that something hidden in your being springs up suddenly like a Jack-in-the-box and takes the helm of your life. Hence, there is only one thing to do, it is to go hunting for all the little dark corners which lie hidden in you and, if you put just a tiny spark of goodwill on this darkness, it will yield, will vanish, and what appeared to you impossible will become not only possible, practicable, but it will have been done. You can in this way in one minute get rid of a difficulty which would have harassed you for years. I absolutely assure you of it. That depends only on one thing: that you truly, sincerely, want to get rid of it. And it is the same for everything, from physical illnesses up to the highest mental difficulties. One part of the consciousness says, \u201cI don\u2019t want it\u201d, but behind there hides a heap of things which say nothing, do not show themselves, and which just want that things continue as they are\u2014generally out of ignorance; they do not believe that it is necessary to be cured, they believe that everything is for the best in the best of worlds."

    {
        "question": "What are the root causes of depression?",
        "answer": "Depression is a sign of weakness, of a bad will somewhere, and bad will in the sense of a refusal to receive help, and a kind of weakness that\u2019s content to be weak. One becomes slack. The bad will is obvious, because there\u2019s a part of your being which tells you at that moment, 'Depression is bad.' You know that you shouldn\u2019t get depressed; well, the reply of that part which is depressed is almost, 'Shut up! I want my depression.' It is always like that."

        "question": "What happens when one slips into depression?",

    {
        "question": "What is the normal state of things regarding depression?",
        "answer": "Every desire which is not satisfied, every impulse which meets an obstacle, every unpleasant contact with outside things, very easily and very spontaneously creates depression or revolt."

    {
        "question": "What does depression signify in terms of personal expression?",
        "answer": "It is always a kind of way of expressing one\u2019s dissatisfaction. 'I am not happy about what you demand', but this means, 'I am not happy. And I shall make you too see it, that I am not happy.'"
    },
    {
        "question": "From where does depression come?",
        "answer": "It comes from disharmony in the being, from a lack of receptivity to the divine forces. When you cut yourself off from energy and light that sustain you, then there is this depression."

    {
        "question": "What is the nature and source of desire?",
        "answer": "Desire is the most obscure and obscuring movement of the lower nature, arising from weakness and ignorance. It is not generated by individuals but is instead waves from the vast sea of the lower nature that invade those who are open and defenseless."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can one distinguish between a legitimate need and a desire?",
        "answer": "To determine if it is a need or desire, closely examine your feelings about not obtaining the thing. If the immediate reaction is that it would be very bad, it is likely a desire. If you feel joy at the thought of having it, it is a desire; if you feel depressed at the thought of not getting it, it is also a desire."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens to unfulfilled desires?",
        "answer": "Unfulfilled desires are projected outside oneself and can return after a long time, often when forgotten. They act like a little personality that roams the world, and eventually, they may return to you, sometimes years later, having done their work."
    },
    {
        "question": "Is desire contagious?",
        "answer": "Yes, desire is very contagious, even more so than illness. It can pass from one person to another without awareness, leading one to feel something springing up within them as if it was their own."
    },
    {
        "question": "Where does desire come from?",
        "answer": "Desire comes from ignorance, as stated by the Buddha. It arises from a belief that one needs something else to be satisfied, and once satisfied, the desire often fades away."
    },
    {
        "question": "What did the Buddha say about overcoming desire?",
        "answer": "The Buddha said that there is greater joy in overcoming a desire than in satisfying it. This experience can lead to a sense of liberation and inner joy."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can you provide an example of overcoming desire bringing greater joy?",
        "answer": "An example is of a lady at an opera who, noticing a minister unable to see the performance, selflessly moved back to allow him a better view. In doing so, she experienced a profound joy and peace from her selfless act, which was greater than the enjoyment of the opera itself."
    },
    {
        "question": "How to overcome the impulses of desire?",
        "answer": "Desire always takes a long time to get rid of entirely. But, if you can once get it out of the nature and realise it as a force coming from outside and putting its claws into the vital and physical, it will be easier to get rid of the invader. You are too accustomed to feel it as part of yourself or planted in you\u2014that makes it more difficult for you to deal with its movements and dismiss its ancient control over you. The rejection of desire is essentially the rejection of the element of craving, putting that out from the consciousness itself as a foreign element not belonging to the true self and the inner nature. But refusal to indulge the suggestions of desire is also a part of the rejection; to abstain from the action suggested, if it is not the right action, must be included in the Yogic discipline. It is only when this is done in the wrong way, by a mental ascetic principle or a hard moral rule, that it can be called suppression. The difference between suppression and an inward essential rejection is the difference between mental or moral control and a spiritual purification. When one lives in the true consciousness one feels the desires outside oneself, entering from outside, from the universal lower Prakriti, into the mind and the vital parts. In the ordinary human condition this is not felt; men become aware of the desire only when it is there, when it has come inside and found a lodging or a habitual harbourage and so they think it is their own and a part of themselves. The first condition for getting rid of desire is, therefore, to become conscious with the true consciousness; for then it becomes much easier to dismiss it than when one has to struggle with it as if it were a constituent part of oneself to be thrown out from the being. It is easier to cast off an accretion than to excise what is felt as a parcel of our substance."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the process of overcoming desire according to the text?",
        "answer": "It happens only when you have decided: \u201cWell, this time, I am going to try not to do it, and I shall not do it, I shall apply all my strength and I shall not do it.\u201d Even if you have just a little success, it is much. Not a big success, but just a small success, a very partial success: you do not carry out what you yearn to do; but the yearning, the desire, the passion is still there and that produces whirls within, but outside you resist, \u201cI shall not do it, I shall not move; even if I have to bind myself hand and foot, I shall not do it.\u201d It is a partial success\u2014 but it is a great victory because, due to this, next time you will be able to do a little more. That is to say, instead of holding all the violent passions within yourself, you can begin calming them a little; and you will calm them slowly at first, with difficulty. They will remain long, they will come back, they will trouble you, vex you, produce in you a great disgust, all that, but if you resist well and say: \u201cNo, I shall carry out nothing; whatever the cost, I shall not carry out anything; I will stay like a rock\u201d, then little by little, little by little, that thins out, thins out and you begin to learn the second attitude: \u201cNow I want my consciousness to be above those things. There will still be many battles but if my consciousness stands above that, little by little there will come a time when this will return no longer.\u201d And then there is a time when you feel that you are absolutely free: you do not even perceive it, and then that is all. It may take a long time, it may come soon: that depends on the strength of character, on the sincerity of the aspiration. But even for people who have just a little sincerity, if they subject themselves to this process, they succeed. It takes time. They succeed in the first item: in not expressing. All forces upon earth tend towards self-expression. These forces come with the object of manifesting themselves and if you place a barrier and refuse to express them, they may try to beat against the barrier for a time, but in the end, they will tire themselves out and not being manifested, they will withdraw and leave you quiet."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the effective order to overcome desire?",
        "answer": "So you must never say: \u201cI shall first purify my thought, purify my body, purify my vital and then later I shall purify my action.\u201d That is the normal order, but it never succeeds. The effective order is to begin from the outside: \u201cThe very first thing is that I do not do it, and afterwards, I desire it no longer and next I close my doors completely to all impulses: they no longer exist for me, I am now outside all that.\u201d This is the true order, the order that is effective. First, not to do it. And then you will no longer have desire for anything and after that it will go out of your consciousness completely."

        "question": "How to develop intuition?",
        "answer": "There are different kinds of intuition, and we carry these capacities within us. They are always active to some extent but we don\u2019t notice them because we don\u2019t pay enough attention to what is going on in us."

    {
        "question": "What is the difference between intuition and subconscious reasoning?",
        "answer": "In the ordinary functioning of the brain, intuition is something which suddenly falls like a drop of light. If one has the faculty, the beginning of a faculty of mental vision, it gives the impression of something coming from outside or above, like a little impact of a drop of light in the brain, absolutely independent of all reasoning. This must not be mistaken for intuition."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can one contact intuition?",
        "answer": "If you want to contact the intuition, you must keep the forehead completely immobile. Active thought must be stopped as far as possible and the entire mental faculty must form\u2014a kind of mirror, very quiet, very still, turned upwards, in silent, very concentrated attention."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens when you succeed in making a 'mirror' for intuition?",
        "answer": "As soon as one succeeds in making a 'mirror', still and attentive, one always obtains a result, not necessarily with a precise form of thought but always with the sensations of a light coming from above."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should one do with the light received from above?",
        "answer": "If one can receive this light coming from above without entering immediately into a whirl of activity, receive it in calm and silence and let it penetrate deep into the being, then after a while it expresses itself either as a luminous thought or as a very precise indication."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is necessary for the guidance of intuition to have its maximum power?",

    },
    {

        "answer": "Devotion without gratitude is quite incomplete, gratitude must come with devotion. There is nothing which gives you a joy equal to that of gratitude. One hears a bird sing, sees a lovely flower, looks at a little child, observes an act of generosity, reads a beautiful sentence, looks at the setting sun, no matter what, suddenly this comes upon you, this kind of emotion\u2014indeed so deep, so intense\u2014that the world manifests the Divine, that there is something behind the world which is the Divine.

Love come to us in many ways; it may come as an awakening to the beauty of the Lover, by the sight of an ideal face and image of him, by his mysterious hints to us of himself behind the thousand faces of things in the world, by a slow or sudden need of the heart, by a vague thirst in the soul, by the sense of someone near us drawing us or pursuing us with love or of someone blissful and beautiful whom we must discover.

        "question": "How to discover the luminous potential hidden behind our dark defects?",
        "answer": "If you look at yourself carefully, you will see that one always carries in oneself the opposite of the virtue one has to realise (I use \u201cvirtue\u201d in its widest and highest sense). You have a special aim, a special mission, a special realisation which is your very own, each one individually, and you carry in yourself all the obstacles necessary to make your realisation perfect. Always you will see that within you the shadow and the light are equal: you have an ability, you have also the negation of this ability. But if you discover a very black hole, a thick shadow, be sure there is somewhere in you a great light. It is up to you to know how to use the one to realise the other. This is a fact very little spoken about, but one of capital importance. And if you observe carefully you will see that it is always thus with everyone. This leads us to statements which are paradoxical but absolutely true; for instance, that the greatest thief can be the most honest man (this is not to encourage you to steal, of course!) and the greatest liar can be the most truthful person. So, do not despair if you find in yourself the greatest weakness, for perhaps it is the sign of the greatest divine strength. Do not say, \u201cI am like that, I can\u2019t be otherwise.\u201d It is not true. You are \u201clike that\u201d because, precisely, you ought to be the opposite. And all your difficulties are there just so that you may learn to transform them into the truth they are hiding. Once you have understood this, many worries come to an end and you are very happy, very happy. If one finds one has very black holes, one says, \u201cThis shows I can rise very high\u201d, if the abyss is very deep, \u201cI can climb very high.\u201d It is the same from the universal point of view; to use the Hindu terminology so familiar to you, it is the greatest Asuras who are the greatest beings of Light. And the day these Asuras are converted, they will be the supreme beings of the creation. This is not to encourage you to be asuric, you know, but it is like that\u2014this will widen your minds a little and help you to free yourself from those ideas of opposing good and evil, for if you abide in that category, there is no hope."
    },
    {
        "question": "What does the nature of your difficulty indicate?",
        "answer": "The nature of your difficulty indicates the nature of the victory you will gain, the victory you will exemplify in Yoga. Thus, if there is persistent selfishness, it points to a realisation of universality as your most prominent achievement in the future. And, when selfishness is there, you have also the power to reverse this very difficulty into its opposite, a victory of utter wideness. When you have something to realise, you will have in you just the characteristic which is the contradiction of that something. Face to face with the defect, the difficulty, you say, \u201cOh, I am like that! How awful it is!\u201d But you ought to see the truth of the situation. Say to yourself, \u201cMy difficulty shows me clearly what I have ultimately to represent. To reach the absolute negation of it, the quality at the other pole\u2014this is my mission.\u201d Even in ordinary life, we have sometimes the experience of contraries. He who is very timid and has no courage in front of circumstances proves capable of bearing the most! To one who has the aspiration for the Divine, the difficulty which is always before him is the door by which he will attain God in his own individual manner: it is his particular path towards the Divine Realisation. There is also the fact that if somebody has a hundred difficulties it means he will have a tremendous realisation\u2014provided, of course, there are in him patience and endurance and he keeps the aspiring flame of Agni burning against those defects. And remember: the Grace of the Divine is generally proportioned to your difficulties."

    {
        "question": "How to grow through human love to divine love?",
        "answer": "It is said that to become conscious of divine Love all other love has to be abandoned. The best way of rejecting the other love which clings so obstinately is to go through it. To see what is behind it, not to stop at the appearance, and to look for the principle which is behind this love. Then the outer form will crumble of itself and you will be in contact with the divine Love which is behind all things."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difficulty in rejecting human love to find divine love?",
        "answer": "To want to get rid of the one in order to find the other is very difficult. Human nature is so limited and full of contradictions that if one makes an inner effort to reject human love, one usually rejects the entire capacity of feeling love and becomes like a stone."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should one do when love comes in any form?",
        "answer": "When love comes, one should try to pierce through its outer appearance and find the divine principle which is behind it. Instead of ceasing to love because one loves wrongly, one must cease to love wrongly and want to love well."
    },
    {
        "question": "How should one approach love between human beings?",

    },
    {
        "question": "What is the first step to loving better?",

    {
        "question": "What is the relationship between yoga and love?",
        "answer": "In yoga, one must have the will to pierce through the limited and human form of love and discover the principle of divine Love behind it. This approach is better than drying up one\u2019s heart."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the essence of love according to the text?",

    },
    {
        "question": "How to be guided by the Divine Will?",
        "answer": "You have a will and you can offer that will. Take the example of becoming conscious of your nights. If you take the attitude of passive surrender, you would say, \u201cWhen it is the Divine Will that I should become conscious, then I shall become conscious.\u201d On the other hand, if you offer your will to the Divine, you begin to will, you say, \u201cI will become conscious of my nights.\u201d You have the will that it should be done; you do not sit down idle and wait. The surrender comes in when you take the attitude that says, \u201cI give my will to the Divine. I intensely want to become conscious of my nights, I have not the knowledge, let the Divine Will work it out for me.\u201d Your will must continue to act steadily, not in the way of choosing a particular action or demanding a particular object, but as an ardent aspiration concentrated upon the end to be achieved. This is the first step. If you are vigilant, if your attention is alert, you will certainly receive something in the form of an inspiration of what is to be done and that you must forthwith proceed to do. Only, you must remember that to surrender is to accept whatever is the result of your action, though the result may be quite different from what you expect. On the other hand, if your surrender is passive, you will do nothing and try nothing; you will simply go to sleep and wait for a miracle. Now to know whether your will or desire is in agreement with the Divine Will or not, you must look and see whether you have an answer or have no answer, whether you feel supported or contradicted, not by the mind or the vital or the body, but by that something which is always there deep in the inner being, in your heart."

But since we usually give the name \u201cdream\u201d to a considerable number of activities that differ completely from one another, the first point is to learn to distinguish between these various activities\u2014that is, to recognise what part of the being it is that \u201cdreams\u201d, what domain it is that one \u201cdreams\u201d in, and what the nature of that activity is."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why do we forget our dreams?",

If you were in conscious, direct, continuous communication with all the parts of your being, you would remember all your dreams. But very few parts of the being are in communication."

        "question": "How to cut the knot of ego?",
        "answer": "Take a sword and strike it (laughter), when one becomes conscious of it. For usually one is not; we think it quite normal, what happen to us; and in fact it is very normal but we think it quite good also. So to begin with one must have a great clear-sightedness to become aware that one is enclosed in all these knots which hold one in bondage. And then, when one is aware that there\u2019s something altogether tightly closed in there\u2014so tightly that one has tried in vain to move it\u2014then one imagines his will to be a very sharp sword-blade, and with all one\u2019s force one strikes a blow on this knot (imaginary, of course, one doesn\u2019t take up a sword in fact), and this produces a result. Of course you can do this work from the psychological point of view, discovering all the elements constituting this knot, the whole set of resistances, habits, preferences, of all that holds you narrowly closed in. So when you grow aware of this, you can concentrate and call the divine Force and the Grace and strike a good blow on this formation, these things so closely held, like that, that nothing can separate them. And at that moment you must resolve that you will no longer listen to these things, that you will listen only to the divine Consciousness and will do no other work except the divine work without worrying about personal results, free from all attachment, free from all preference, free from all wish for success, power, satisfaction, vanity, all this\u2026 All this must disappear and you must see only the divine Will incarnated in your will and making you act."

    {
        "question": "Are there any signs which indicate that one is ready for the path, especially if one has no spiritual teacher?",
        "answer": "Yes, the most important indication is a perfect equality of soul in all circumstances. It is an absolutely indispensable basis; something very quiet, calm, peaceful, the feeling of a great force. Not the quietness that comes from inertia but the sensation of a concentrated power which keeps you always steady, whatever happens, even in circumstances which may appear to you the most terrible in your life. That is the first sign."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the difference between outer equality and the equality of the soul?",
        "answer": "The equality of the soul is a psychological thing. It is the power to bear all happenings, good or bad, without being sad, discouraged, desperate, upset. Whatever happens, you remain serene, peaceful. The other is the equality in the body. It is not psychological, it is something material; to have a physical poise, to receive forces without being troubled. The two are equally necessary if one wants to progress on the path. And other things still. For example, a mental poise; such that all possible ideas, even the most contradictory, may come from all sides without one\u2019s being troubled. One can see them and put each in its place. That is mental poise."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does Equality mean a passive and inert acceptance of success and failure?",
        "answer": "Equality is a very important part of this yoga; it is necessary to keep equality under pain and suffering\u2014and that means to endure firmly and calmly, not to be restless or troubled or depressed or despondent, to go on with a steady faith in the Divine Will. But equality does not include inert acceptance. If, for instance, there is temporary failure of some endeavour in the sadhana, one has to keep equality, not to be troubled or despondent, but one has not to accept the failure as an indication of the Divine Will and give up the endeavour. You ought rather to find out the reason and meaning of the failure and go forward in faith towards victory. So with illness\u2014you have not to be troubled, shaken or restless, but you have not to accept illness as the Divine Will, but rather look upon it as an imperfection of the body to be got rid of as you try to get rid of vital imperfections or mental errors."
    },
    {
        "question": "Does Equality mean that one should see Truth and Falsehood as equal?",
        "answer": "No doubt, hatred and cursing are not the proper attitude. It is true also that to look upon all things and all people with a calm and clear vision, to be uninvolved and impartial in one's judgments is a quite proper yogic attitude. A condition of perfect samata can be established in which one sees all as equal, friends and enemies included, and is not disturbed by what men do or by what happens. The question is whether this is all that is demanded from us. If so, then the general attitude will be of a neutral indifference to everything. But the Gita, which strongly insists on a perfect and absolute samata, goes on to say, \u201cFight, destroy the adversary, conquer.\u201d If there is no kind of general action wanted, no loyalty to Truth as against Falsehood except for one's personal sadhana, no will for the Truth to conquer, then the samata of indifference will suffice. But here there is a work to be done, a Truth to be established against which immense forces are arranged, invisible forces which can use visible things and persons and actions for their instruments. If one is among the disciples, the seekers of this Truth, one has to take sides for the Truth, to stand against the forces that attack it and seek to stifle it. Arjuna wanted not to stand for either side, to refuse any action of hostility even against assailants; Sri Krishna, who insisted so much on samata, strongly rebuked his attitude and insisted equally on his fighting the adversary. \u201cHave samata,\u201d he said, \u201cand seeing clearly the Truth, fight.\u201d Therefore to take sides with the Truth and to refuse to concede anything to the Falsehood that attacks, to be unflinchingly loyal and against the hostiles and the attackers, is not inconsistent with equality."

        "answer": "Faith is the soul's witness to something not yet manifested, achieved or realised, but which yet the Knower within us, even in the absence of all indications, feels to be true or supremely worth following or achieving. This thing within us can last even when there is no fixed belief in the mind, even when the vital struggles and revolts and refuses. The fundamental faith in yoga is this, inherent in the soul, that the Divine exists and the Divine is the one thing to be followed after\u2014nothing else in life is worth having in comparison with that."

        "answer": "Mental faith combats doubt and helps to open to the true knowledge; vital faith prevents the attacks of the hostile forces or defeats them and helps to open to the true spiritual will and action; physical faith keeps one firm through all physical obscurity, inertia or suffering and helps to open to the foundation of the true consciousness; psychic faith opens to the direct touch of the Divine and helps to bring union and surrender."

        "answer": "The phrase 'blind faith' has no real meaning. Faith is something which one has before proof or knowledge and it helps you to arrive at knowledge or experience. The faith in spiritual things that is asked of the sadhak is not an ignorant but a luminous faith, a faith in light and not in darkness."

    {

        "answer": "Faith is certainly a gift given to us by the Divine Grace. It is possible that in some exceptional circumstances, faith may come almost accidentally, but most frequently it is an answer to a yearning, a need, an aspiration. When faith has been granted, individual effort is indispensable to preserve it. One must hold on to one\u2019s faith, will one\u2019s faith; one must seek it, cultivate it, protect it."
    },
    {
        "question": "How to cherish and develop faith?",
        "answer": "Faith is certainly a gift given to us by the Divine Grace. It is like a door suddenly opening upon an eternal truth, through which we can see it, almost touch it. As in everything else in the ascent of humanity, there is the necessity\u2014especially at the beginning\u2014of personal effort. It is possible that in some exceptional circumstances, for reasons which completely elude our intelligence, faith may come almost accidentally, quite unexpectedly, almost without ever having been solicited, but most frequently it is an answer to a yearning, a need, an aspiration, something in the being that is seeking and longing, even though not in a very conscious and systematic way. But in any case, when faith has been granted, when one has had this sudden inner illumination, in order to preserve it constantly in the active consciousness individual effort is altogether indispensable. One must hold on to one\u2019s faith, will one\u2019s faith; one must seek it, cultivate it, protect it. In the human mind there is a morbid and deplorable habit of doubt, argument, scepticism. This is where human effort must be put in: the refusal to admit them, the refusal to listen to them and still more the refusal to follow them. No game is more dangerous than playing mentally with doubt and scepticism. They are not only enemies, they are terrible pitfalls, and once one falls into them, it becomes tremendously difficult to pull oneself out. Some people think it is a very great mental elegance to play with ideas, to discuss them, to contradict their faith; they think that this gives them a very superior attitude, that in this way they are above \u201csuperstitions\u201d and \u201cignorance\u201d; but if you listen to suggestions of doubt and scepticism, then you fall into the grossest ignorance and stray away from the right path. You enter into confusion, error, a maze of contradictions\u2026. You are not always sure you will be able to get out of it. You go so far away from the inner truth that you lose sight of it and sometimes lose too all possible contact with your soul. Certainly a personal effort is needed to preserve one\u2019s faith, to let it grow within. Later\u2014much later\u2014one day, looking back, we may see that everything that happened, even what seemed to us the worst, was a Divine Grace to make us advance on the way; and then we become aware that the personal effort too was a grace. But before reaching that point, one has to advance much, to struggle much, sometimes even to suffer a great deal. To sit down in inert passivity and say, \u201cIf I am to have faith I shall have it, the Divine will give it to me\u201d, is an attitude of laziness, of unconsciousness and almost of bad-will. For the inner flame to burn, one must feed it; one must watch over the fire, throw into it the fuel of all the errors one wants to get rid of, all that delays the progress, all that darkens the path. If one doesn\u2019t feed the fire, it smoulders under the ashes of one\u2019s unconsciousness and inertia, and then, not years but lives, centuries will pass before one reaches the goal. One must watch over one\u2019s faith as one watches over the birth of something infinitely precious, and protect it very carefully from everything that can impair it. In the ignorance and darkness of the beginning, faith is the most direct expression of the Divine Power which comes to fight and conquer."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can faith be increased?",
        "answer": "Through aspiration, I suppose. Some have it spontaneously\u2026 You see, it is difficult to pray if one doesn\u2019t have faith, but if one can make prayer a means of increasing one\u2019s faith, or aspiring, having an aspiration, having an aspiration to have faith\u2026 Most of these qualities require an effort. If one does not have a thing and wants to have it, well, it needs great, great, great sustained efforts, a constant aspiration, an unflagging will, a sincerity at each moment; then one is sure, it will come one day\u2014it can come in a second. There are people who have it, and then they have contrary movements which come and attack. These people, if their will is sincere, can shield their faith, repel the attacks. There are others who cultivate doubt because it is a kind of dilettantism\u2014that, there\u2019s nothing more dangerous than that. It is as though one were letting the worm into the fruit: it eventually eats it up completely. This means that when a movement of this sort comes\u2014it usually comes first into the mind\u2014the first thing to do is to be very plucky and refuse it. Surely one must not enjoy looking on just to see what is going to happen; that kind of curiosity is terribly dangerous. It is perhaps more difficult for intellectuals to have faith than for those who have a simple, sincere and upright heart, and no intellectual complications. But I think that if an intellectual person has faith, then that becomes very powerful, a very powerful thing which can truly work miracles."

        "question": "Is there a Destiny or is there only Free-Will?",
        "answer": "You have quoted Cheiro\u2019s successes, but what about his failures? I have looked at the book and was rather staggered by the number of prophecies that have failed to come off. You can\u2019t deduce from a small number of predictions, however accurate, that all is predestined down to your putting the questions in the letter and my answer. It may be, but the evidence is not sufficient to prove it. What is evident is that there is an element of the predictable, predictable accurately and in detail as well as in large points, in the course of events. But that was already known; it leaves the question still unsolved whether all is predictable, whether destiny is the sole factor in existence or there are other factors also that can modify destiny,\u2014or, destiny being given, there are not different sources or powers or planes of destiny and we can modify the one with which we started by calling in another destiny source, power or plane and making it active in our life. Metaphysical questions are not so simple that they can be trenchantly solved either in one sense or in another contradictory to it\u2014that is the popular way of settling things, but it is quite summary and inconclusive. All is free-will or else all is destiny\u2014it is not so simple as that. This question of free-will or determination is the most knotty of all metaphysical questions and nobody has been able to solve it\u2014for a good reason that both destiny and will exist and even a free-will exists somewhere; the difficulty is only how to get at it and make it effective."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the Indian explanation of fate?",
        "answer": "The Indian explanation of fate is Karma. We ourselves are our own fate through our actions, but the fate created by us binds us; for what we have sown, we must reap in this life or another. Still we are creating our fate for the future even while undergoing old fate from the past in the present. That gives a meaning to our will and action and does not, as European critics wrongly believe, constitute a rigid and sterilising fatalism. But again, our will and action can often annul or modify even the past Karma, it is only certain strong effects, called utkata karma, that are non-modifiable. Here too the achievement of the spiritual consciousness and life is supposed to annul or give the power to annul Karma. For we enter into union with the Will Divine, cosmic or transcendent, which can annul what it had sanctioned for certain conditions, new-create what it had created, the narrow fixed lines disappear, there is a more plastic freedom and wideness. Neither Karma nor Astrology therefore points to a rigid and for ever immutable fate."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is said about prophecy?",
        "answer": "As for prophecy, I have never met or known of a prophet, however reputed, who was infallible. Some of their predictions come true to the letter, others do not,\u2014they half-fulfil or misfire entirely. It does not follow that the power of prophecy is unreal or the accurate predictions can be all explained by probability, chance, coincidence. The nature and number of those that cannot is too great. The variability of fulfilment may be explained either by an imperfect power in the prophet sometimes active, sometimes failing or by the fact that things are predictable in part only, they are determined in part only or else by different factors or lines of power, different series of potentials and actuals. So long as one is in touch with one line, one predicts accurately, otherwise not\u2014or if the lines of power change, one\u2019s prophecy also goes off the rails. All the same, one may say, there must be, if things are predictable at all, some power or plane through which or on which all is foreseeable; if there is a divine Omniscience and Omnipotence, it must be so. Even then what is foreseen has to be worked out, actually is worked out by a play of forces,\u2014spiritual, mental, vital and physical forces\u2014and in that plane of forces there is no absolute rigidity discoverable. Personal will or endeavour is one of those forces. Napoleon when asked why he believed in Fate, yet was always planning and acting, answered, 'Because it is fated that I should work and plan'; in other words, his planning and acting were part of Fate, contributed to the results Fate had in view. Even if I foresee an adverse result, I must work for the one that I consider should be; for it keeps alive the force, the principle of Truth which I serve and gives it a possibility to triumph hereafter so that it becomes part of the working of the future favourable Fate, even if the fate of the hour is adverse. Men do not abandon a cause because they have seen it fail or foresee its failure; and they are spiritually right in their stubborn perseverance. Moreover, we do not live for outward result alone; far more the object of life is the growth of the soul,\u2014not outward success of the hour or even of the near future. The soul can grow against or even by a material destiny that is adverse."

Only, you know, in ordinary life one says, 'It is circumstances, it is fate, it\u2019s my bad luck, it is their fault', or else, 'I have no luck.' That is very, very, very convenient. One veils everything and expects... yes, one has happy moments and then bad ones, and finally\u2014ah, well, finally one falls into a hole, for everybody tumbles over, and expects to, sooner or later. So, one does not worry, or worries all the time\u2014which comes to the same thing. That is, one is unconscious, one lives unconsciously and puts all the blame for what happens on others and on the circumstances but never tells oneself: 'Why! It is my own fault.'... It needs a sufficiently vast consciousness to begin. Even among those who profess to be conscious, there are not many who see clearly enough to become aware that all that happens to them comes from what they are and from nothing else. They always say, 'He is wrong; circumstances are unfavourable; oh! Why was that done?'\u2014If you were not what you are, it would not happen in this way. It would happen differently."

One can\u2019t do otherwise\u2014unless constantly, without a break, we remain completely aware and, as soon as an element is introduced into our body, we immediately work upon it to extract from it only the light and reject all that may darken our consciousness. This is the origin and rational explanation of the religious practice of consecrating one\u2019s food to God before taking it. When eating one aspires that this food may not be taken for the little human ego but as an offering to the divine consciousness within oneself."

    {
        "question": "What is the significance of offering food to the Divine before eating?",
        "answer": "As long as our body is compelled to take in foreign matter in order to subsist, it will absorb at the same time a considerable amount of inert and unconscious forces or those having a rather undesirable consciousness and this alchemy must take place inside the body. We were speaking of the kinds of consciousness absorbed with food, but there is also the inconscience that\u2019s absorbed with food\u2014quite a deal of it. And that is why in many yogas there was the advice to offer to the Divine what one was going to eat before eating it. It consists in calling the Divine down into the food before eating it. One offers it to Him\u2014that is, one puts it in contact with the Divine, so that it may be under the divine influence when one eats it. It is very useful, it is very good. If one knows how to do it, it is very useful, it considerably reduces the work of inner transformation which has to be done."

        "answer": "Too much eating makes the body material and heavy, eating too little makes it weak and nervous\u2014one has to find the true harmony and balance between the body's need and the food taken. What is necessary is to take enough food and think no more about it, taking it as a means for the maintenance of the physical instrument only. But just as one should not overeat, so one should not diminish unduly\u2014it produces a reaction which defeats the object\u2014for the object is not to allow either the greed for food or the heavy tamas of the physical which is the result of excessive eating to interfere with the concentration on the spiritual experience and progress."

        "answer": "The body in its normal state, that is to say, when there is no intervention of mental notions or vital impulses, also knows very well what is good and necessary for it; but for this to be effective in practice, one must educate the child with care and teach him to distinguish his desires from his needs. He should be helped to develop a taste for food that is simple and healthy, substantial and appetising, but free from any useless complications."

        "answer": "In a greater or lesser proportion you swallow along with the meat a little of the consciousness of the animal you eat. It is not very serious, but it is not always very pleasant. And obviously it does not help you in being on the side of man rather than of the beast! For an ordinary man, living an ordinary life, having ordinary activities, it is good to eat meat, it is all right for him to eat anything at all, whatever agrees with him, whatever does him good. But if one wishes to pass from this ordinary life to a higher one, the problem begins to become interesting."

        "answer": "Naturally that depends on each one; everyone has his special way of forgetting himself, which is the best for him. But obviously there is a fairly general method which may be applied in various forms: to occupy oneself with something else. Instead of being occupied with oneself, one may be busy with someone else or with others or some work or an interesting activity requiring concentration. And it is still the same thing: instead of doubling up on oneself and brooding over oneself or coddling oneself as it were, like the most precious thing in the world, if one can unfold oneself and get busy with something else, something which is not quite one\u2019s own self, then that is the simplest and quickest way of forgetting oneself. There are many others but this one is within everyone\u2019s reach."

These images can move about (like cinema images), but they have no substantial reality. It is the fear or emotion of those who see these images that sometimes gives them the appearance of a power or an action they do not possess in themselves.

    {
        "question": "How to accept Grace with gratitude?",
        "answer": "Ah! First of all you must feel the need for it. This is the most important point. It is to have a certain inner humility which makes you aware of your helplessness without the Grace, that truly, without it you are incomplete and powerless. This, to begin with, is the first thing. It is an experience one can very well have. When, you see, even people who know nothing find themselves in quite difficult circumstances or facing a problem which must be solved or, as I just told you, an impulse which must be overcome or something that has disturbed them\u2026 and then they realise they are lost, they don\u2019t know what to do\u2014neither their mind nor their will nor their feelings help\u2014they don\u2019t know what to do, then it happen; there is within them something like a kind of call, a call to something which can do what one cannot. One aspires to something which is capable of doing what one can\u2019t do. This is the first condition. And then, if you become aware that it is only the Grace which can do that, that the situation in which you find yourself, from there the Grace alone can pull you out, can give you the solution and the strength to come out of it, then, quite naturally an intense aspiration awakes in you, a consciousness which is translated into an opening. If you call, aspire, and if you hope to get an answer, you will quite naturally open yourself to the Grace. And later\u2014you must pay great attention to this (Mother puts her finger on her lips)\u2014the Grace will answer you, the Grace will pull you out of the trouble, the Grace will give you the solution to your problem or will help you to get out of your difficulty. But once you are free from trouble and have come out of your difficulty, don\u2019t forget that it is the Grace which pulled you out, and don\u2019t think it is yourself. For this, indeed, is the important point. Most people, as soon as the difficulty has gone, say, \u201cAfter all, I pulled myself out of the difficulty quite well.\u201d There you are. And then you lock and bolt the door, you see, and you cannot receive anything any more. You need once again some acute anguish, some terrible difficulty for this kind of inner stupidity to give way, and for you to realise once more that you can do nothing. Because it is only when you grow aware that you are powerless that you begin to be just a little open and plastic. But so long as you think that what you do depends on your own skill and your own capacity, truly, not only do you close one door, but, you know, you close lots of doors one upon another, and bolt them. You shut yourself up in a fortress and nothing can enter there. That is the great drawback: one forgets very quickly. Quite naturally one is satisfied with one\u2019s own capacity."

You must become conscious of this first, and once you are conscious of it, you try to adapt the outer action, outer movements to the inner ideal. But first of all you must become aware of the disharmony. For there are many people who think that everything is going well; and if they are told, \u201cNo, your outer nature is in contradiction with your inner aspiration\u201d, they protest. They are not aware. Therefore, the first step is to become aware, to become conscious of what is not in tune."

        "question": "How to stop the of illness before they enter into us?",
        "answer": "First of all, you must not want it and nothing in the body must want it. You must have a very strong will not to be ill. This is the first condition. The second condition is to call the light, a light of equilibrium, a light of peace, quietude and balance, and to push it into all the cells of the body, enjoining them not to be afraid, because that again is another condition. First, not to want to be ill, and then not to be afraid of illness. You must neither attract it nor tremble. You must not want illness at all. But you must not because of fear not want it; you must not be afraid; you must have a calm certitude and a complete trust in the power of the Grace to shelter you from everything, and then think of something else, not be concerned about this any longer. When you have done these two things, refusing the illness with all your will and infusing a confidence which completely eliminates the fear in the cells of the body, and then busying yourself with something else, not thinking any longer about the illness, forgetting that it exists\u2026 there, if you know how to do that, you may even be in contact with people who have contagious diseases, and yet you do not catch them. But you must know how to do this. Many people say, \u201cOh, yes, here I am not afraid.\u201d They don\u2019t have any fear in the mind, their mind is not afraid, it is strong, it is not afraid; but the body trembles, and one doesn\u2019t know it, because it is in the cells of the body that the trembling goes on. It trembles with a terrible anxiety and this is what attracts the illness. It is there that you must put the force and the quietude of a perfect peace and an absolute trust in the Grace. And then, sometimes you are obliged to drive away with a similar force in your thought all suggestions that after all, the physical world is full of illnesses, and these are contagious, and because one was in contact with somebody who is ill, one is sure to catch it, and then, that the inner methods are not powerful enough to act on the physical, and all kinds of stupidities of which the air is full. These are collective suggestions which are passed on from one person to another by everybody. And if by chance there are two or three doctors, then it becomes terrible."

    },
    {
        "question": "How to receive the inner guidance?",
        "answer": "The first condition is not to begin thinking about the subject and building all sorts of ideas: opposing ideas, possibilities, and entering into a formidable mental activity. First of all, you must put the problem as though you were putting it to someone else, then keep silent, remain like that, immobile. And then, after a little while you will see that at least three different things may happen, sometimes more. Take the case of an intellectual, one who acts in accordance with the indications of his head. He has put the problem and he waits. Well, if he is indeed attentive, he will notice that there is (the chronological order is not absolute, it may come in a different order) at first (what is most prominent in an intellectual) a certain idea: \u201cIf I do that in this way, it will be all right; it must be like that\u201d, that is to say, a mental construction. A second thing which is a kind of impulse: \u201cThat will have to be done. That is good, it must be done.\u201d Then a third which does not make any noise at all, does not try to impose itself on the others, but has the tranquillity of a certitude\u2014not very active, not giving a shock, not pushing to action, but something that knows and is very quiet, very still. This will not contradict the others, will not come and say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s wrong\u201d; it says simply, \u201cSee, it is like this\u201d, that\u2019s all, and then it does not insist. The majority of men are not silent enough or attentive enough to be aware of it, for it makes no noise. But I assure you it is there in everybody and if one is truly sincere and succeeds in being truly quiet, one will become aware of it. The thinking part begins to argue, \u201cBut after all, this thing will have this consequence and that thing will have that consequence, and if one does this\u2026\u201d and this, and that\u2026 and its noise begins again. The other (the vital) will say, \u201cYes, it must be done like that, it must be done, you don\u2019t understand, it must, it is indispensable.\u201d There! Then you will know. And according to your nature you will choose either the vital impulse or the mental leading, but very seldom do you say quite calmly, \u201cGood, it is this I am going to do, whatever happens\u201d, and even if you don\u2019t like it very much. But it is always there. I am sure that it is there even in the murderer before he kills, you understand, but his outer being makes such a lot of noise that it never even occurs to him to listen. But it is always there, always there. In every circumstance, there is in the depth of every being, just this little (one can\u2019t call it \u201cvoice\u201d, for it makes no sound) this little indication of the divine Grace, and sometimes to obey it requires a tremendous effort, for all the rest of the being opposes it violently, one part with the conviction that what it thinks is true, another with all the power, the strength of its desire. But don\u2019t tell me that one can\u2019t know, for that is not true. One can know. But one does not always know what is necessary, and sometimes, if one knows what is to be done, well, one finds some excuse or other for not doing it. One tells oneself, \u201cOh! I am not so sure, after all, of this inner indication; it does not assert itself with sufficient force for me to trust it.\u201d But if you were quite indifferent, that is, if you had no desire, either mental or vital or physical desire, you would know with certainty that it is that which must be done and nothing else. What comes and gets in the way is preference\u2014preferences and desires. Every day one may have hundreds and hundreds of examples. When people begin to say, \u201cTruly I don\u2019t know what to do\u201d, it always means that they have a preference. But as here in the Ashram they know there is something else and as at times they have been a little attentive, they have a vague sensation that it is not quite that: \u201cIt is not quite that, I don\u2019t feel quite at ease.\u201d Besides, you were saying a while ago that it is the result which gives you the indication; it has even been said (it has been written in books) that one judges the divine Will by the results! All that succeeds has been willed by the Divine; all that doesn\u2019t, well, He has not willed it! This is yet again one of those stupidities big as a mountain. It is a mental simplification of the problem, which is quite comic. That\u2019s not it. If one can have an indication (in proportion to one\u2019s sincerity), it is uneasiness, a little uneasiness\u2014not a great uneasiness, just a little uneasiness."

        "question": "How our outer life can be an anvil for testing our inner progress?",
        "answer": "When you sit down in isolation, in complete silence and far away from everybody, and examine yourself with more or less indulgent eyes, you may imagine that you are realising something wonderful. But when you are put to the test at every minute of your life, when you have the occasion to become aware of your imperfections, your infirmities, your little movements of bad will a hundred times a day, you soon lose the illusion of being\u20262 and so your efforts are more sincere. That is why, instead of deciding that we would have an Ashram in a solitary forest where everything is very beautiful, very restful, instead of being aloof from the world and attending only to our own little selves, we are trying on the contrary to take up all the activities of life and make them as conscious as we can, and, in our contacts with other people, to become more clearly aware of all the inner movements. Running away from difficulties is never a way of surmounting or overcoming them. If you flee from the enemy you won\u2019t be able to defeat him and he has every chance of defeating you. That is why we are here in Pondicherry and not on some Himalayan peak. Although I admit that a Himalayan peak would be delightful\u2014but perhaps not so effective."

        "question": "What is the proper function of the intellect? Is it a help or an obstruction to spiritual progress?",
        "answer": "Whether the intellect is a help or a hindrance depends upon the person and upon the way in which it is used. There is a true movement of the intellect and there is a wrong movement; one helps, the other hinders. The intellect that believes too much in its own importance and wants satisfaction for its own sake, is an obstacle to the higher realisation. But this is true not in any special sense or for the intellect alone, but generally and of other faculties as well. For example, people do not regard an all-engrossing satisfaction of the vital desires or the animal appetites as a virtue; the moral sense is accepted as a mentor to tell one the bounds that one may not transgress. It is only in his intellectual activities that man thinks he can do without any such mentor or censor! Any part of the being that keeps to its proper place and plays its appointed role is helpful; but directly it steps beyond its sphere, it becomes twisted and perverted and therefore false. A power has the right movement when it is set into activity for the divine\u2019s purpose; it has the wrong movement when it is set into activity for its own satisfaction. The intellect, in its true nature, is an instrument of expression and action. It is something like an intermediary between the true knowledge, whose seat is in the higher regions above the mind, and realisation here below. The intellect or, generally speaking, the mind gives the form; the vital puts in the dynamism and life-power; the material comes in last and embodies."

But if, when you have to face anguish, suffering, revolt, pain or a feeling of helplessness\u2014 whatever it may be, all the things that come to you on the path and which precisely are your difficulties\u2014if physically, that is to say, in your body-consciousness, you can have the feeling of widening yourself, one could say of unfolding yourself\u2014you feel as it were all folded up, one fold on another like a piece of cloth which is folded and refolded and folded again\u2014so if you have this feeling that what is holding and strangling you and making you suffer or paralysing your movement, is like a too closely, too tightly folded piece of cloth or like a parcel that is too well-tied, too well-packed, and that slowly, gradually, you undo all the folds and stretch yourself out exactly as one unfolds a piece of cloth or a sheet of paper and spreads it out flat, and you lie flat and make yourself very wide, as wide as possible, spreading yourself out as far as you can, opening yourself and stretching out in an attitude of complete passivity with what I could call \u201cthe face to the light\u201d: not curling back upon your difficulty, doubling up on it, shutting it in, so to say, into yourself, but, on the contrary, unfurling yourself as much as you can, as perfectly as you can, putting the difficulty before the Light\u2014the Light which comes from above\u2014if you do that in all the domains, and even if mentally you don\u2019t succeed in doing it\u2014for it is sometimes difficult\u2014if you can imagine yourself doing this physically, almost materially, well, when you have finished unfolding yourself and stretching yourself out, you will find that more than three-quarters of the difficulty is gone. And then just a little work of receptivity to the Light and the last quarter will disappear. This is much easier than struggling against a difficulty with one\u2019s thought, for if you begin to discuss with yourself, you will find that there are arguments for and against which are so convincing that it is quite impossible to get out of it without a higher light. Here, you do not struggle against the difficulty, you do not try to convince yourself; ah! you simply stretch out in the Light as though you lay stretched on the sands in the sun. And you let the Light do its work. That\u2019s all."

        "answer": "When you want to know what your soul knows, you have to make an inner effort, to be very attentive; and indeed, if you are attentive, behind the outer noise of the mind and the vital, you can discern something very subtle, very quiet, very peaceful, which knows and says what it knows. But the insistence of the others is so imperious, while that is so quiet, that you are very easily misled into listening to the one that makes the most noise; most often, you become aware only afterwards that the other one was right. It does not impose itself, it does not compel you to listen, for it is without violence."

    {
        "question": "What happens when you hesitate about what to do?",
        "answer": "When you hesitate, when you wonder what to do in this or that circumstance, there comes the desire, the preference both mental and vital, that press, insist, affirm and impose themselves, and, with the best reasons in the world, build up a whole case for themselves. And if you are not on the alert, if you don\u2019t have a firm discipline, if you don\u2019t have the habit of control, they finally convince you that they are right."

        "answer": "This 'Don\u2019t do it' comes often, but you discard it as something which has no power and follow your impulsive destiny. But if you are truly sincere in your will to find and live the truth, then you learn to listen better and better, you learn to discriminate more and more, and even if it costs you an effort, even if it causes you pain, you learn to obey."

        "question": "How to discover the luminous potential hidden behind our dark defects?",
        "answer": "If you look at yourself carefully, you will see that one always carries in oneself the opposite of the virtue one has to realise (I use \u201cvirtue\u201d in its widest and highest sense). You have a special aim, a special mission, a special realisation which is your very own, each one individually, and you carry in yourself all the obstacles necessary to make your realisation perfect. Always you will see that within you the shadow and the light are equal: you have an ability, you have also the negation of this ability. But if you discover a very black hole, a thick shadow, be sure there is somewhere in you a great light. It is up to you to know how to use the one to realise the other. This is a fact very little spoken about, but one of capital importance. And if you observe carefully you will see that it is always thus with everyone. This leads us to statements which are paradoxical but absolutely true; for instance, that the greatest thief can be the most honest man (this is not to encourage you to steal, of course!) and the greatest liar can be the most truthful person. So, do not despair if you find in yourself the greatest weakness, for perhaps it is the sign of the greatest divine strength. Do not say, \u201cI am like that, I can\u2019t be otherwise.\u201d It is not true. You are \u201clike that\u201d because, precisely, you ought to be the opposite. And all your difficulties are there just so that you may learn to transform them into the truth they are hiding. Once you have understood this, many worries come to an end and you are very happy, very happy. If one finds one has very black holes, one says, \u201cThis shows I can rise very high\u201d, if the abyss is very deep, \u201cI can climb very high.\u201d"

        "question": "How to get the most effective mantra?",
        "answer": "When you are playing and suddenly become aware that something is going wrong\u2014you are making mistakes, are inattentive, sometimes opposing currents come across what you are doing\u2014if you develop the habit, automatically at this moment, of calling as by a mantra, of repeating a word, that has an extraordinary effect. You choose your mantra; or rather, one day it comes to you spontaneously in a moment of difficulty. At a time when things are very difficult, when you have a sort of anguish, anxiety, when you don\u2019t know what is going to happen, suddenly this springs up in you, the word springs up in you. For each one it may be different. But if you mark this and each time you face a difficulty you repeat it, it becomes irresistible. For instance, if you feel you are about to fall ill, if you feel you are doing badly what you are doing, if you feel something evil is going to attack you, then\u2026. But it must be a spontaneity in the being, it must spring up from you without your needing to think about it: you choose your mantra because it is a spontaneous expression of your aspiration; it may be one word, two or three words, a sentence, that depends on each one, but it must be a sound which awakens in you a certain condition. Then, when you have that, I assure you that you can pass through everything without difficulty. Even in the face of a real, veritable danger, an attack, for instance, by someone who wants to kill you, if, without getting excited, without being perturbed, you quietly repeat your mantra, one can do nothing to you. Naturally, you must truly be master of yourself; one part of the being must not be trembling there like a leaf; no, you must do it entirely, sincerely, then it is all-powerful. The best is when the word comes to you spontaneously: you call in a moment of great difficulty (mental, vital, physical, emotional, whatever it may be) and suddenly that springs up in you, two or three words, like magical words. You must remember these and form the habit of repeating them in moments when difficulties come. If you form the habit, one day it will come to you spontaneously: when the difficulty comes, at the same time the mantra will come. Then you will see that the results are wonderful. But it must not be an artificial thing or something you arbitrarily decide: \u201cI shall use those words\u201d; nor should somebody else tell you, \u201cOh! You know, this is very good\u201d\u2014it is perhaps very good for him but not for everyone."

        "question": "What is the meaning and importance of Japa? What is its value and how should one do it?",
        "answer": "The japa is usually successful only on one of two conditions\u2014if it is repeated with a sense of its significance, a dwelling of something in the mind on the nature, power, beauty, attraction of the Godhead it signifies and is to bring into the consciousness,\u2014 that is the mental way; or if it comes up from the heart or rings in it with a certain sense or feeling of bhakti making it alive,\u2014 that is the emotional way. Either the mind or the vital has to give it support or sustenance. But if it makes the mind dry and the vital restless, it must be missing that support and sustenance. There is, of course, a third way, the reliance on the power of the mantra or name in itself; but then one has to go on till that power has sufficiently impressed its vibration on the inner being to make it at a given moment suddenly open to the Presence or the Touch. But if there is a struggling or insistence for the result, then this effect which needs a quiet receptivity in the mind is impeded. That is why I insisted so much on mental quietude and not on too much straining or effort, to give time to allow the psychic and the mind to develop the necessary condition of receptivity\u2014a receptivity as natural as when one receives an inspiration for poetry and music. It is also why I do not want you to discontinue your poetry\u2014it helps and does not hinder the preparation, because it is a means of developing the right position of receptivity and bringing out the bhakti which is there in the inner being. To spend all the energy in japa or meditation is a strain which even those who are accustomed to successful meditation find it difficult to maintain\u2014unless in periods when there is an uninterrupted flow of experiences from above."

        "question": "What is OM in the context of Mantra?",
        "answer": "OM is the signature of the Lord. OM is the mantra, the expressive sound-symbol of the Brahman Consciousness in its four domains from the Turiya to the external or material plane. The function of a mantra is to create vibrations in the inner consciousness that will prepare it for the realisation of what the mantra symbolises and is supposed indeed to carry within itself. The mantra OM should therefore lead towards the opening of the consciousness to the sight and feeling of the One Consciousness in all material things, in the inner being and in the supraphysical worlds, in the causal plane above now superconscient to us and, finally, the supreme liberated transcendence above all cosmic existence. The last is usually the main preoccupation with those who use the mantra."

        "answer": "In this yoga there is no fixed mantra, no stress is laid on mantras, although sadhaks can use one if they find it helpful or so long as they find it helpful. The stress is rather on an aspiration in the consciousness and a concentration of the mind, heart, will, all the being. If a mantra is found helpful for that, one uses it. OM if rightly used (not mechanically) might very well help the opening upwards and outwards (cosmic consciousness) as well as the descent."

To understand the full importance of this mastery by becoming aware, through observation, that our actions are the exact expression of our thoughts and that so long as we do not have perfect control over our mental activity, these thoughts are nothing but reflexes coming from every outside influence (sensations and suggestions).

    {
        "question": "What does Meditation Mean?",
        "answer": "Meditation means properly the concentration of the mind on a single train of ideas which work out a single subject. Contemplation means regarding mentally a single object, image, idea so that the knowledge about the object, image or idea may arise naturally in the mind by force of the concentration. Both these things are forms of dhyana, for the principle of dhyana is mental concentration whether in thought, vision or knowledge. There are other forms of dhyana. This may be called concentration in self-observation. This form leads to another, the emptying of all thought out of the mind so as to leave it a sort of pure vigilant blank on which the divine knowledge may come and imprint itself. Meditation is the easiest process for the human mind, but the narrowest in its results; contemplation more difficult, but greater; self-observation and liberation from the chains of Thought the most difficult of all, but the widest and greatest in its fruits."

        "question": "What is the Purpose of Meditation?",

You may meditate to open yourself to the divine Force, reject the ordinary consciousness, enter the depths of your being, learn how to give yourself integrally, or for peace and calm.

Others try to concentrate on a point to intensify their power of concentration. Some try to drive out all thoughts to achieve a truly silent tranquility, which is extremely difficult.

        "answer": "Dynamic meditation is a meditation that has the power of transforming your being.

For a meditation to be dynamic, one must have an aspiration for progress and the meditation must be done to help and fulfill this aspiration."

In some the aspiration moves on the mental level or in the vital field; some have a spiritual aspiration. On the quality of the aspiration depends the force that answers and the work that it comes to do. To make yourself blank in meditation creates an inner silence; it does not mean that you have become nothing or have become a dead and inert mass. Making yourself an empty vessel, you invite that which shall fill it. It means that you release the stress of your inner consciousness towards realisation. The nature of the consciousness and the degree of its stress determine the forces that you bring into play and whether they shall help and fulfil or fail or even harm and hinder."

    {
        "question": "What is the main condition for effective meditation?",
        "answer": "In your meditation the first imperative need is a state of perfect and absolute sincerity in all the consciousness. It is indispensable that you should not deceive yourself or deceive or be deceived by others. Often people have a wish, a mental preference or vital desire; they want the experience to happen in a particular way or to take a turn that satisfies their ideas or desires or preferences; they do not keep themselves blank and unprejudiced and simply and sincerely observe what happens. Then if you do not like what happens, it is easy to deceive yourself; you will see one thing, but give it a little twist and make it something else, or you will distort something simple and straightforward or magnify it into an extraordinary experience. When you sit in meditation you must be as candid and simple as a child, not interfering by your external mind, expecting nothing, insisting on nothing. Once this condition is there, all the rest depends upon the aspiration deep within you. If you ask from within for peace, it will come; if for strength, for power, for knowledge, they too will come, but all in the measure of your capacity to receive it. And if you call upon the Divine, then too\u2014always admitting that the Divine is open to your call, and that means your call is pure enough and strong enough to reach him,\u2014you will have the answer."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why all kinds of thought come by when we begin to meditate and how to deal with it?",
        "answer": "Perhaps they came and you did not know it! Perhaps it is because you want to concentrate that you become aware that they are there. It may also happen that there is an element of contradiction in the consciousness and that when you want to be silent, something says, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t be silent!\u201d I think that many of you have an inner contradiction like this. When you have resolved to be good, there is something which would like to push you into being wicked, and when you want to be quiet, there is something which pushes you into being agitated, and when you want to be silent, immediately thoughts begin to wander. It is a contradiction inherent in man\u2019s nature. It may be this; it may be what I said: that all these thoughts are there but as you were not paying any attention to them, you were not aware of them. It is quite certain that to create absolute silence is of all things the most difficult, for many things of which one was not aware, become enormous! There were all kinds of suggestion, movements, thoughts, formations which went on as though automatically in the outer consciousness, almost outside the consciousness, on the frontiers of consciousness; and as soon as one wants to be absolutely silent, one becomes aware of all these things which go on moving, moving, moving and make a lot of noise and prevent you from being silent. That is why it is better to remain very quiet, very calm and at the same time very attentive to something which is above you and to which you aspire, and if there is this kind of noise passing like that (Mother moves her hands around her head), not to pay attention, not to look, not to heed it. If there are thoughts which go round and round and round like this (gestures), which come and go, do not look, do not pay attention, but concentrate upwards in a great aspiration which one may even formulate\u2014because often it helps the concentration\u2014towards the light, the peace, the quietude, towards a kind of inner impassiveness, so that the concentration may be strong enough for you not to attend to all that continues to whirl about all around. But if suddenly you say, \u201cAh, there\u2019s some noise! Oh, here is a thought!\u201d, then it is finished. You will never succeed in being quiet. Have you never seen those people who try to stop a quarrel by shouting still louder than the ones who are quarrelling? Well, it is something like that."
    },
    {
        "question": "How to examine our mind?",
        "answer": "The first is: to observe one\u2019s mind. Do not believe that it is such an easy thing, for to observe your thoughts, you must first of all separate yourself from them. In the ordinary state, the ordinary man does not distinguish himself from his thoughts. He does not even know that he thinks. He thinks by habit. And if he is asked all of a sudden, \u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d, he knows nothing about it. That is to say, ninety-five times out of a hundred he will answer, \u201cI do not know.\u201d There is a complete identification between the movement of thought and the consciousness of the being. To observe the thought, the first movement then is to step back and look at it, to separate yourself from your thoughts so that the movement of the consciousness and that of thought may not be confused. Thus when we say that one must observe one\u2019s thoughts, do not believe that it is so simple; it is the first step. I suggest that this evening in our meditation we take up this first exercise which consists in standing back from one\u2019s thought and looking at it."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the two kinds of thought?",
        "answer": "It seems to me that we must first of all distinguish two very different kinds, or I might say qualities, of thought: thoughts in us which are the result, the fruit, as it were, of our sensations, and thoughts which, like living beings, come to us\u2014from where?\u2026 most often we do not know\u2014thoughts that we perceive mentally before they express themselves in our outer being as sensations."

    {
        "question": "What happens when you objectivise and keep at a distance incoherent thoughts?",
        "answer": "When you are able by methodical and repeated effort to objectivise and keep at a distance all this flood of incoherent thoughts which assail us, you will notice a new phenomenon. You will observe within yourself certain thoughts that are stronger and more tenacious than others, thoughts concerning social usages, customs, moral rules and even general laws that govern earth and man. They are your opinions on these subjects or at least those you profess and by which you try to act."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why do we hold certain opinions?",
        "answer": "Look at one of these ideas, the one most familiar to you, look at it very carefully, concentrate, reflect in all sincerity, if possible leaving aside all bliss, and ask yourself why you have this option on that subject rather than any other. The answer will almost invariably be the same, or nearly: Because it is the opinion prevalent in your environment, because it is considered good form to have it and therefore saves you from as many clashes, frictions, criticisms as possible. Or because this was the opinion of your father or mother, the opinion which moulded your childhood. Or else because this opinion is the normal outcome of the education, religious or otherwise, you received in your youth."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is required for a thought to be considered your own?",
        "answer": "This thought is not your own thought. For, to be your own thought, it would have to form part of a logical synthesis you had elaborated in the course of your existence, either by observation, experience and deduction, or by deep, abstract meditation and contemplation."
    },
    {
        "question": "What do we act according to?",
        "answer": "Since we have goodwill and endeavour to be integrally sincere, that is, to make our actions conform to our thoughts, we are now convinced that we act according to mental laws we receive from outside, not after having maturely considered and analysed them, not by deliberately and consciously receiving them, but because unconsciously we are subjected to them through atavism, by our upbringing and education, and above all because we are dominated by a collective suggestion which is so powerful, so overwhelming, that very few succeed in avoiding it altogether."

        "question": "How to establish peace in our mind?",
        "answer": "First of all, you must want it. And then you must try and must persevere, continue trying. What I have just told you is a very good means. Yet there are others also. You sit quietly, to begin with; and then, instead of thinking of fifty things, you begin saying to yourself, \u201cPeace, peace, peace, peace, peace, calm, peace!\u201d You imagine peace and calm. You aspire, ask that it may come: \u201cPeace, peace, calm.\u201d And then, when something comes and touches you and acts, say quietly, like this, \u201cPeace, peace, peace.\u201d Do not look at the thoughts, do not listen to the thoughts, you understand. You must not pay attention to everything that comes. You know, when someone bothers you a great deal and you want to get rid of him, you don\u2019t listen to him, do you? Good! You turn your head away (gesture) and think of something else. Well, you must do that: when thoughts come, you must not look at them, must not listen to them, must not pay any attention at all, you must behave as though they did not exist, you see! And then, repeat all the time like a kind of\u2014how shall I put it?\u2014as an idiot does, who repeats the same thing always. Well, you must do the same thing; you must repeat, \u201cPeace, peace, peace.\u201d So you try this for a few minutes and then do what you have to do; and then, another time, you begin again; sit down again and then try. Do this on getting up in the morning, do this in the evening when going to bed. You can do this\u2026 look, if you want to digest your food properly, you can do this for a few minutes before eating. You can\u2019t imagine how much this helps your digestion! Before beginning to eat you sit quietly for a while and say, \u201cPeace, peace, peace!\u201d and everything becomes calm. It seems as though all the noises were going far, far, far away (Mother stretches out her arms on both sides) and then you must continue; and there comes a time when you no longer need to sit down, and no matter what you are doing, no matter what you are saying, it is always \u201cPeace, peace, peace.\u201d"

        "question": "From what plane does music generally come?",
        "answer": "There are different levels. There is a whole category of music that comes from the higher vital, which is very catching, somewhat vulgar, it is something that twists your nerves. This music is not necessarily unpleasant, but generally it seizes you there in the nervous centres. So there is one type of music which has a vital origin. There is music which has a psychic origin\u2014it is altogether different. And then there is music which has a spiritual origin: it is very bright and it carries you away, captures you entirely. But if you want to execute this music correctly you must be able to make it come through the vital passage. Your music coming from above may become externally quite flat if you do not possess that intensity of vital vibration which gives it its splendour and strength. I knew people who had truly a very high inspiration and it became quite flat, because the vital did not stir. I must admit that by their spiritual practices they had put to sleep their vital completely\u2014it was literally asleep, it did not act at all\u2014and the music came straight into the physical, and if one were connected with the origin of that music, one could see that it was something wonderful, but externally it had no force, it was a little melody, very poor, very thin; there was none of the strength of harmony. When you can bring the vital into play, then all the strength of vibration is there. If you draw into it this higher origin, it becomes the music of a genius."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the cause of the great difference between European and Indian music? Is it the origin or the expression?",
        "answer": "It is both but in an inverse sense. This very high inspiration comes only rarely in European music; rare also is a psychic origin, very rare. Either it comes from high above or it is vital. The expression is almost always, except in a few rare cases, a vital expression\u2014interesting, powerful. Most often, the origin is purely vital. Sometimes it comes from the very heights, then it is wonderful. Sometimes it is psychic, particularly in what has been religious music, but this is not very frequent. Indian music, when there are good musicians, has almost always a psychic origin; for example, the ragas have a psychic origin, they come from the psychic. The inspiration does not often come from above. But Indian music is very rarely embodied in a strong vital. It has rather an inner and intimate origin. I have heard a great deal of Indian music, a great deal; I have rarely heard Indian music having vital strength, very rarely; perhaps not more than four or five times. But very often I have heard Indian music having a psychic origin, it translates itself almost directly into the physical. And truly one must then concentrate, and as it is\u2014how to put it?\u2014very tenuous, very subtle, as there are none of those intense vital vibrations, one can easily glide within it and climb back to the psychic origin of the music. It has that effect upon you, it is a kind of ecstatic trance, as from an intoxication. It makes you enter a little into trance. Then if you listen well and let yourself go, you move on and glide, glide into a psychic consciousness."

        "question": "Mother, when one hears music, how should one truly hear it?",
        "answer": "For this\u2014if one can be completely silent, you see, silent and attentive, simply as though one were an instrument which has to record it\u2014one does not move, and is only something that is listening\u2014if one can be absolutely silent, absolutely still and like that, then the thing enters. And it is only later, some time later, that you can become aware of the effect, either of what it meant or the impression it had on you. But the best way of listening is this. It is to be like a still mirror and very concentrated, very silent. In fact, we see people who truly love music... I have seen musicians listening to music, musicians, composers or players who truly love music, I have seen them listening to music... they sit completely still, you know, they are like that, they do not move at all. Everything, everything is like that. And if one can stop thinking, then it is very good, then one profits fully.... It is one of the methods of inner opening and one of the most powerful."

    {
        "question": "What should one try to do when one meditates with your music at the Playground?",
        "answer": "This music aims at awakening certain profound feelings. To hear it one should make oneself as silent and passive as possible. And if, in the mental silence, a part of the being can take the attitude of the witness who observes without reacting or participating, then one can take account of the effect which the music produces on the feelings and emotions; and if it produces a state of deep calm and of semi-trance, then that is quite good."

    {
        "question": "How to organise our consciousness?",
        "answer": "One must be clearly aware of the origin of one\u2019s movements because there are contradictory velleities in the being\u2014some pushing you here, others pushing you there, and that obviously creates a chaos in life. If you observe yourself, you will see that as soon as you do something which disturbs you a little, the mind immediately gives you a favourable reason to justify yourself\u2014this mind is capable of gilding everything. In these conditions it is difficult to know oneself. One must be absolutely sincere to be able to do it and to see clearly into all the little falsehoods of the mental being."
    },
    {
        "question": "What should one do to progress in self-awareness?",
        "answer": "If in your mind you go over the various movements and reactions of the day like one repeating indefinitely the same thing, you will not progress. If this reviewing is to make you progress, you must find something within you in whose light you yourself can be your own judge, something which represents for you the best part of yourself, which has some light, some goodwill and which precisely is in love with progress."

        "question": "How can one evaluate their actions and thoughts?",
        "answer": "Place that before you and, first of all, pass across it as at a cinema all that you have done, all that you have felt, your impulses, your thoughts, etc.; then try to coordinate them, that is, find out why this has followed that. And look at the luminous screen that is before you: certain things pass across it well, without throwing a shadow; others, on the contrary, throw a little shadow; others yet cast a shadow altogether black and disagreeable."

    {
        "question": "What does it mean if an action casts a shadow on the screen of self-evaluation?",
        "answer": "If it was in keeping with my ideal, it would not leave any shadow on the screen, which would remain transparent, and one would not have to worry about it. If it is not in conformity, it casts a shadow. Why has it left this shadow? What was there in this act that was contrary to the will to self-knowledge and self-mastery?"
    },
    {
        "question": "What should one do when they identify a shadow in their actions?",
        "answer": "Most often you will find that it corresponds to unconsciousness\u2014then you file it among unconscious things and resolve that next time you will try to be conscious before doing anything. But in other cases you will see that it was a nasty little egoism, quite black, which had come to distort your action or your thought."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can one confront their egoism?",
        "answer": "Then you place this egoism before your 'light' and ask yourself: 'Why has it the right to make me act like that, think like that?\u2026' And instead of accepting any odd explanation you must search and you will find in a corner of your being something which thinks and says, 'Ah, no, I shall accept everything but that.' You will see that it is a petty vanity, a movement of self-love, an egoistic feeling hidden somewhere, a hundred things."

        "question": "What is the process of transforming one's inner disorder?",
        "answer": "Then you take a good look at these things in the light of your ideal: 'Is cherishing this movement in conformity with my seeking and the realisation of my ideal or not? I put this little dark corner in front of the light until the light enters into it and it disappears.' Then the comedy is over."

        "question": "How to help others with our thoughts?",
        "answer": "You can make good formations and if you make them properly, they will act in the same way as the others. You can do a lot of good to people just by sitting quietly in your room, perhaps even more good than by undergoing a lot of trouble externally. If you know how to think correctly, with force and intelligence and kindness, if you love someone and wish him well very sincerely, deeply, with all your heart, that does him much good, much more certainly than you think."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the advantage of mental formations?",
        "answer": "If one thinks clearly and powerfully, one makes a mental formation, and that every mental formation is an entity independent of its fashioner, having its own life and tending to realise itself in the mental world."
    },
    {
        "question": "What gives strength and persistence to mental formations?",

        "question": "What should one do if they have faith in divine Grace?",
        "answer": "If one has trust in the divine Grace, and that this something can answer a prayer, an aspiration, an invocation, then, after making one\u2019s mental formation, if one offers it to the Grace and puts one\u2019s trust in it, asks it to intervene and has the faith that it will intervene, then indeed one has a chance of success."

    },
    {
        "question": "How to overcome fear?",
        "answer": "That depends upon who you are. There are many ways of curing oneself of fear. If you have some contact with your psychic being, you must call it immediately and in the psychic light put things back in order. This is the most powerful way. When one does not have this psychic contact, but is still a reasonable being, that is, when one has a free movement of the reasoning mind, one can use it to reason with, to speak to oneself as one would to a child, explaining that this fear is a bad thing in itself and, even if there is a danger, to face the danger with fear is the greatest stupidity. If there is a real danger, it is only with the power of courage that you have a chance of coming out of it; if you have the least fear, you are done for. So with that kind of reasoning, manage to convince the part that fears that it must stop being afraid. If you have faith and are consecrated to the Divine, there is a very simple way, it is to say: \u201cLet Your will be done. Nothing can frighten me because it is You who are guiding my life. I belong to You and You are guiding my life.\u201d That acts immediately. Of all the means this is the most effective: indeed, it is. That is, one must be truly consecrated to the Divine. If one has that, it acts immediately; all fear vanishes immediately like a dream. And the being with the bad influence also disappears like a dream along with the fear. You should see it running away at full speed, prrt! Voil\u00e0. Now, there are people having a strong vital power in them and they are fighters who immediately lift up their heads and say: \u201cAh! an enemy is here, we are going to knock him down.\u201d But for that one must have the knowledge and a very great vital power. One must be vitally a giant. That does not happen to everyone. So there are many different ways. They are all good, if you know how to make use of the one that suits your own nature."

    {
        "question": "How to deal with pain?",
        "answer": "The first thing and the most indispensable is to nullify the pain by cutting the connection. You see, one becomes conscious of the pain because it is there. For example, you have cut your finger, there\u2019s a nerve that has been affected, and so the nerve quickly goes to tell the brain, up there, that something has happened which is wrong, here. That is what gives you the pain to awaken your attention, to tell you: \u201cYou know, there\u2019s something wrong.\u201d Then the thought immediately feels anxious: \u201cWhat is wrong? Oh! How it hurts\u201d, etc., etc.\u2014then returns to the finger and tries to arrange what is not yet destroyed. Usually one puts a small bandage. But in order not to have the pain, if it hurts very much, you must quite simply cut the connection by thought, saying to the nerve, \u201cNow remain quiet, you have done your work, you have warned me, you don\u2019t need to say anything any longer; ploff! I am stopping you.\u201d And when you do it well, you suffer no longer, it is finished, you stop the pain completely. That is the best thing. It is infinitely preferable to telling yourself that it is painful."

        "question": "What is the method for dealing with an ingrowing nail?",
        "answer": "I knew a boy who started pressing his nail, like this (gesture), with the idea that pain is simply an incapacity to bear certain intensities of vibrations, you see; so he went beyond the measure, and in fact he pressed, it hurt abominably at first, he pressed until his hurt was changed into a kind of pleasure, and this succeeded very well. If you have some pain, and you give yourself much more pain still, then finally there\u2019s a moment when you either faint away (people who are a little weak and not very enduring faint) or else it changes into pleasure; but this is not recommendable. I am just telling you that it can be done. I saw a boy\u2014he was twelve\u2014who was doing that, and he was doing it very deliberately, very consciously. He had never heard of yoga but he had found it out all by himself. But this is not recommendable because his toe became worse. This didn\u2019t make it better at all."

        "answer": "When one has a very bad toothache (I don\u2019t know if you have a toothache sometimes or not; a toothache hurts terribly because the nerve is quite, quite close to the brain, so it doesn\u2019t lose its intensity on the way, it is very direct and hurts very much), the best way\u2014in fact there\u2019s no other\u2014the best way is to cut it: \u201cIt is good, you have done your work, you told me that something was wrong there, that\u2019s enough, don\u2019t move now.\u201d And one cuts, cuts it like this (gesture), cuts the connection, it doesn\u2019t transmit again. Naturally you must think of something else. If afterwards you start saying, \u201cDo I still have the pain?\u2026\u201d."

        "question": "How can we establish a settled peace and silence in the mind?",
        "answer": "First of all, you must want it. And then you must try and must persevere, keep on trying. What I have just told you is a very good means. Yet there are others also. You sit quietly, to begin with; and then, instead of thinking of fifty things, you begin saying to yourself, \u201cPeace, peace, peace, peace, peace, calm, peace!\u201d You imagine peace and calm. You aspire, ask that it may come: \u201cPeace, peace, calm.\u201d And then, when something comes and touches you and acts, say quietly, like this, \u201cPeace, peace, peace.\u201d Do not look at the thoughts, do not listen to the thoughts, you understand. You must not pay attention to everything that comes. You know, when someone bothers you a great deal and you want to get rid of him, you don\u2019t listen to him, do you? Good! You turn your head away and think of something else. Well, you must do that: when thoughts come, you must not look at them, must not listen to them, must not pay any attention at all, you must behave as though they did not exist, you see! And then, repeat all the time like a kind of\u2014how shall I put it?\u2014as an idiot does, who repeats the same thing always. Well, you must do the same thing; you must repeat, \u201cPeace, peace, peace.\u201d So you try this for a few minutes and then do that you have to do; and then, another time, you begin again; sit down again and then try. Do this on getting up in the morning, do this in the evening when going to bed. You can do this... look, if you want to digest your food properly, you can do this for a few minutes before eating. You can\u2019t imagine how much this helps your digestion! Before beginning to eat you sit quietly for a while and say, \u201cPeace, peace, peace!\u201d and everything becomes calm. It seems as though all the noises were going far, far, far away and then you must continue; and there comes a time when you no longer need to sit down, and no matter what you are doing, no matter what you are saying, it is always \u201cPeace, peace, peace.\u201d Everything remains here, like this, it does not enter, it remains like this. And then one is always in a perfect peace... after some years. But at the beginning, a very small beginning, two or three minutes, it is very simple. For something complicated you must make an effort, and when one makes an effort, one is not quiet. It is difficult to make an effort while remaining quiet. Very simple, very simple, you must be very simple in these things. It is as though you were learning how to call a friend: by dint of being called he comes. Well, make peace and calm your friends and call them: \u201cCome, peace, peace, peace, peace, come!\u201d"
    },
    {
        "question": "Can one be peaceful in activity?",
        "answer": "Yes certainly - the peace starts in the inner being - it is spiritual and psychic but it overflows the outer being. When it is there in the activity, it means either that the ordinary restless mind, vital, physical have been submerged by the flood of the inner peace or, at a more advanced stage, they have been partially or wholly changed into thoughts, forces, emotions, sensations which have in their very stuff an essence of inner silence and peace. When the peace is fully established everywhere in the being, these things (reactions of the lower vital) will not be able to shake it. They may come first as ripples on the surface, then only as suggestions which one looks at or does not care to look at but in either case they don\u2019t get inside, affect or disturb at all. It is difficult to explain but it is something like a mountain at which one may throw stones - if conscious all through the mountain may feel the touch of the stones but the thing would be so slight and superficial that it would not be in the least affected."

        "answer": "To want what the Divine wants, in all sincerity, is the essential condition for peace and joy in life. Almost all human miseries come from the fact that men are nearly always convinced that they know better than the Divine what they need and what life ought to give them. Most human beings want other human beings to conform to their expectations and circumstances to conform to their desires- therefore they suffer and are unhappy."

        "question": "How to grow through relationship by looking at others as a mirror?",
        "answer": "It is rather remarkable that when we have a weakness\u2014for example a ridiculous habit, a defect or an imperfection\u2014since it is more or less part of our nature, we consider it to be very natural, it does not shock us. But as soon as we see this same weakness, this same imperfection, this same ridiculous habit in someone else, it seems quite shocking to us and we say, \u201cWhat! He\u2019s like that?\u201d\u2014without noticing that we ourselves are \u201clike that.\u201d And so to the weakness and imperfection we add the absurdity of not even noticing them. There is a lesson to be drawn from this. When something in a person seems to you completely unacceptable or ridiculous\u2014\u201cWhat! He is like that, he behaves like that, he says things like that, he does things like that\u201d\u2014you should say to yourself, \u201cWell, well, but perhaps I do the same thing without being aware of it. I would do better to look into myself first before criticising him, so as to make sure that I am not doing the very same thing in a slightly different way.\u201d If you have the good sense and intelligence to do this each time you are shocked by another person\u2019s behaviour, you will realise that in life your relations with others are like a mirror which is presented to you so that you can see more easily and clearly the weaknesses you carry within you."

        "question": "Is it possible to live without quarrelling?",
        "answer": "One can live without quarrelling. It seems strange to say this because as things are, it would seem, on the contrary, that life is made for quarrelling in the sense that the main occupation of people who are together is to quarrel, overtly or covertly."

        "question": "What should you focus on instead of the perfection that others should realise?",

If you are conscious of it, well then, begin with the work which is given to you, that is to say, realise what you have to do and do not concern yourself with what others do, because, after all, it is not your business."

    {
        "question": "How can Religion help in my spiritual growth?",
        "answer": "The articles and dogmas of a religion are mind-made things and, if you cling to them and shut yourself up in a code of life made out for you, you do not know and cannot know the truth of the Spirit that lies beyond all codes and dogmas, wide and large and free. When you stop at a religious creed and tie yourself in it, taking it for the only truth in the world, you stop the advance and widening of your inner soul. But if you look at religion from another angle, it need not always be an obstacle to all men. If you regard it as one of the higher activities of humanity and if you can see in it the aspirations of man without ignoring the imperfection of all man-made things, it may well be a kind of help for you to approach the spiritual life. Taking it up in a serious and earnest spirit, you can try to find out what truth is there, what aspiration lies hidden in it, what divine inspiration has undergone transformation and deformation here by the human mind and a human organisation, and with an appropriate mental stand you can get religion even as it is to throw some light on your way and to lend some support to your spiritual endeavour. In all religions we find invariably a certain number of people who possess a great emotional capacity and are full of a real and ardent aspiration, but have a very simple mind and do not feel the need of approaching the Divine through knowledge. For such natures religion has a use and it is even necessary for them; for, through external forms, like the ceremonies of the Church, it offers a kind of support and help to their inner spiritual aspiration. In every religion there are some who have evolved a high spiritual life. But it is not the religion that gave them their spirituality; it is they who have put their spirituality into the religion."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the importance of free choice in religion?",
        "answer": "If you want to appraise the real value of the religion in which you are born or brought up or to have a correct perspective of the country or society to which you belong by birth, if you want to find out how relative a thing the particular environment is into which you happened to be thrown and confined, you have only to go round the earth and see that what you think good is looked upon as bad elsewhere and what is considered as bad in one place is welcomed as good in another. All countries and all religions are built up out of a mass of traditions. In all of them you will meet saints and heroes and great and mighty personalities as well as small and wicked people. You will then perceive what a mockery it is to say, 'Because I am brought up in this religion, therefore it is the only true religion; because I am born in this country, therefore it is the best of all countries.' Things have an inner value and become real to you only when you have acquired them by the exercise of your free choice, not when they have been imposed upon you. If you want to be sure of your religion, you must choose it; if you want to be sure of your country, you must choose it; if you want to be sure of your family, even that you must choose. If you accept without question what has been given you by Chance, you can never be sure whether it is good or bad for you, whether it is the true thing for your life. Step back from all that forms your natural environment or inheritance, made up and forced upon you by Nature's blind mechanical process; draw within and look quietly and dispassionately at things. Appraise them, choose freely. Then you can say with an inner truth, 'This is my family, this my country, this my religion.'"
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the limitations of religion?",
        "answer": "The strength and greatness of a religion is adjudged by men according to the number of those that follow it, although the real greatness is not there. The greatness of spiritual truth is not in numbers. I knew the head of a new religion, the son of its founder, and heard him say once that such and such a religion took so many hundreds of years to be built up, and such another so many hundreds of years, but they within fifty years had already over four million followers. 'And so you see', he added, 'what a great religion is ours!' Religions may reckon their greatness by the number of their believers, but Truth would still be Truth if it had not even a single follower. The average man is drawn towards those who make great pretensions; he does not go where Truth is quietly manifesting. Those who make great pretensions need to proclaim loudly and to advertise; for otherwise they would not attract great numbers of people. The work that is done with no care for what people think of it is not so well known, does not so easily draw multitudes. But Truth requires no advertisement; it does not hide itself but it does not proclaim itself either. It is content to manifest, regardless of results, not seeking approbation or shunning disapprobation, not attracted or troubled by the world's acceptance or denial. That is why religions are always mistaken\u2014always\u2014because they want to standardise the expression of an experience and impose it on everyone as an irrefutable truth. The experience was true, complete in itself, convincing\u2014for the one who had it. The formulation he made of it was excellent\u2014for himself. But to want to impose it on others is a fundamental error which has altogether disastrous consequences, always, which always leads far, very far from the Truth. That is why all the religions, however beautiful they may be, have always led man to the worst excesses. All the crimes, the horrors perpetrated in the name of religion are among the darkest stains on human history, and simply because of this little initial error: wanting what is true for one individual to be true for the mass or collectivity."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the role of organized religion in spiritual evolution?",
        "answer": "All religions are partial approximations of the one sole Truth that is far above them. Each religion has helped mankind. Paganism increased in man the light of beauty, the largeness and height of his life, his aim at a many-sided perfection; Christianity gave him some vision of divine love and charity; Buddhism has shown him a noble way to be wiser, gentler, purer; Judaism and Islam how to be religiously faithful in action and zealously devoted to God; Hinduism has opened to him the largest and profoundest spiritual possibilities. A great thing would be done if all these God-visions could embrace and cast themselves into each other; but intellectual dogma and cult-egoism stand in the way. All religions have saved a number of souls, but none yet has been able to spiritualise mankind. For that there is needed not cult and creed, but a sustained and all-comprehending effort at spiritual self-evolution."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the hope for a spiritual religion of humanity?",
        "answer": "A spiritual religion of humanity is the hope of the future. By this is not meant what is ordinarily called a universal religion, a system, a thing of creed and intellectual belief and dogma and outward rite. Mankind has tried unity by that means; it has failed and deserved to fail, because there can be no universal religious system, one in mental creed and vital form. The inner spirit is indeed one, but more than any other the spiritual life insists on freedom and variation in its self-expression and means of development. A religion of humanity means the growing realisation that there is a secret Spirit, a divine Reality, in which we are all one, that humanity is its highest present vehicle on earth, that the human race and the human being are the means by which it will progressively reveal itself here. It implies a growing attempt to live out this knowledge and bring about a kingdom of this divine Spirit upon earth. By its growth within us oneness with our fellow-men will become the leading principle of all our life, not merely a principle of cooperation but a deeper brotherhood, a real and an inner sense of unity and equality and a common life. There must be the realisation by the individual that only in the life of his fellow-men is his own life complete. There must be the realisation by the race that only on the free and full life of the individual can its own perfection and permanent happiness be founded. There must be too a discipline and a way of salvation in accordance with this religion, that is to say, a means by which it can be developed by each man within himself, so that it may be developed in the life of the race. A spiritual oneness which would create a psychological oneness not dependent upon any intellectual or outward uniformity and compel a oneness of life not bound up with its mechanical means of unification, but ready always to enrich its secure unity by a free inner variation and a freely varied outer self-expression, this would be the basis for a higher type of human existence."

        "question": "Is the way of surrender the only way to approach the Divine?",
        "answer": "No, there are many ways to approach the Divine, but the way of surrender is the only one known by the author that allows the Divine to take up sadhana as a sensible fact before the preparation of nature is done."

        "question": "What can be done by the Divine?",

        "question": "What is the true significance of birthdays? Why are they given a special importance in the Ashram?",
        "answer": "Yes, it is truly a special day in one's life. It is one of those days in the year when the Supreme descends into us\u2014or when we are face to face with the Eternal - one of those days when our soul comes in contact with the Eternal and, if we remain a little conscious, we can feel His Presence within us. If we make a little effort on this day, we accomplish the work of many lives as in a lightning flash. That is why I give so much importance to the birthday - because what one gains in one day is truly something incomparable. And it is for this that I also work to open the consciousness a little towards what is above so that one may come before the Eternal. My child, it is a very special day, for it is the day of decision, the day one can unite with the Supreme Consciousness. For the Lord lifts us on this day to the highest region possible so that our soul which is a portion of that Eternal Flame, may be united and identified with its origin. This day is truly an opportunity in life. One is so open and so receptive that one can assimilate all that is given. I can do many things, that is why it is important. It is one of those days when the Lord Himself opens the doors wide for us. It is as though He were inviting us to rekindle more powerfully the flame of aspiration. It is one of those days which He gives us. We too by our Personal effort, could attain to this, but it would be long, hard and not so easy. And this is a real chance in life \u2014 the day of the Grace.\u201d"

    {
        "question": "I would like to know the true meaning of birthdays, for it is an important day here.",
        "answer": "From the viewpoint of the inner nature, the individual is more receptive on his birthday from year to year, and thus it is an opportune moment to help him to make some new progress each year."
    },
    {
        "question": "How should one spend one's birthday?",
        "answer": "\u2026in finding out the purpose of life."
    },
    {
        "question": "Today is my birthday. I want this day to be the beginning of a more spiritual life and therefore something has to be done. Please tell me what I must do.",
        "answer": "It is not with the mind that one should decide what has to be done. It should be a spontaneous movement taking place in a sincere and constant aspiration."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the meaning of one's birthday, apart from its commemorative character? How can one take advantage of this occasion?",
        "answer": "Because of the rhythm of the universal forces, a person is supposed to have a special receptivity on his birthday each year. He can therefore take advantage of this receptivity by making good resolutions and fresh progress on the path of his integral development."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is this period of the divine movement?",
        "answer": "For each thing it is different. For each activity, each realisation, each movement, there is a definite period of time, which differs. There are countless periods of time which are entangled; but each thing is regulated by a kind of rhythm which is this thing\u2019s own rhythm. You see, for the facility of their outer existence, men have divided time more or less arbitrarily into years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, etc.; it is a rhythm that\u2019s more or less arbitrary, because it has been created by man, but it has in itself a certain reality, for it corresponds to universal movements... as far as possible. And that is why, by the way, we celebrate the birthday, for example: because there is a certain rhythm in each one\u2019s existence which is established by this regular return of circumstances analogous to those in which he was born. And all movements\u2014when you observe them, you become aware that they have a certain rhythm\u2014the movements of inner consciousness, for example, not only from the point of view of understanding but that of personal reactions, of the ups and downs in progress; of a fairly regular periodic return, at once of advancing and recoiling, of difficulties and of helps. But if each person is attentive he realises that his own rhythm is absolutely particular to him; it is not the same rhythm as his neighbour\u2019s. But even as the seasons follow a certain rhythm, regular enough on the whole, so the individual life has its seasons. And when one studies oneself attentively, one finds out that there are even certain repetitions of analogous circumstances at regular intervals. Even, very sensitive people become aware that there are certain days of the week or certain hours of the day when they can do things more easily. Some of them have particular difficulties on particular days and at particular hours; some on the contrary have better inspirations at particular moments\u2014but every one has to find this out in himself by observation. Naturally it is far from being absolute, it is not strict, and if it is troublesome, it can be eliminated very easily simply by a little effort of resolute will. But if it helps, one can make use of it. And all this, each thing having its own rhythm, well, it makes an extremely complicated criss-crossing of rhythms, which results in what we see: something which seems to have none\u2014because it is too complicated, it is too complex."

    {
        "question": "How to find the solution to a problem or a difficulty in silence?",
        "answer": "To learn to be quiet and silent\u2026 When you have a problem to solve, instead of turning over in your head all the possibilities, all the consequences, all the possible things one should or should not do, if you remain quiet with an aspiration for goodwill, if possible a need for goodwill, the solution comes very quickly. And as you are silent you are able to hear it. When you are caught in a difficulty, try this method: instead of becoming agitated, turning over all the ideas and actively seeking solutions of worrying, fretting, running here and there inside your head\u2014I don\u2019t mean externally, for externally, you probably have enough common sense not to do that! but inside, in your head\u2014remain quiet. And according to your nature, with ardour or peace, with intensity or widening or with all these together, implore the Light and wait for it to come."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can one sleep well?",
        "answer": "To sleep well one must learn how to sleep. If one is physically very tired, it is better not to go to sleep immediately, otherwise one falls into the inconscient. If one is very tired, one must stretch out on the bed, relax, loosen all the nerves one after another until one becomes like a rumpled cloth in one\u2019s bed, as though one had neither bones nor muscles. When one has done that, the same thing must be done in the mind. Relax, do not concentrate on any idea or try to solve a problem or ruminate on impressions, sensations or emotions you had during the day. All that must be allowed to drop off quietly: one gives oneself up, one is indeed like a rag. When you have succeeded in doing this, there is always a little flame, there\u2014that flame never goes out and you become conscious of it when you have managed this relaxation. And all of a sudden this little flame rises slowly into an aspiration for the divine life, the truth, the consciousness of the Divine, the union with the inner being, it goes higher and higher, it rises, rises, like that, very gently. Then everything gathers there, and if at that moment you fall asleep, you have the best sleep you could possibly have. I guarantee that if you do this carefully, you are sure to sleep, and also sure that instead of falling into a dark hole you will sleep in light, and when you get up in the morning you will be fresh, fit, content, happy and full of energy for the day."
    },
    {
        "question": "What happens during sleep?",
        "answer": "According to a recent medical theory one passes in sleep through many phases until one arrives at a state in which there is absolute rest and silence\u2014it lasts only for ten minutes, the rest of the time is taken up by travelling to that and travelling back again to the waking state. I suppose the ten minutes sleep can be called su, supti in the Brahman or Brahmaloka, the rest is svapna or passage through other worlds (planes or states of conscious existence)."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are dreams? What is their nature and importance?",
        "answer": "In principle, to judge the activities of sleep one needs the same capacity of discrimination as to judge the waking activities. But since we usually give the name \u201cdream\u201d to a considerable number of activities that differ completely from one another, the first point is to learn to distinguish between these various activities\u2014that is, to recognise what part of the being it is that \u201cdreams\u201d, what domain it is that one \u201cdreams\u201d in, and what the nature of that activity is."
    },
    {
        "question": "Why do we forget our dreams?",
        "answer": "Because you do not dream always at the same place. It is not always the same part of your being that dreams and it is not at the same place that you dream. If you were in conscious, direct, continuous communication with all the parts of your being, you would remember all your dreams. But very few parts of the being are in communication."
    },
    {
        "question": "Can we have control over our dreams? How to interpret dreams?",
        "answer": "There are also other dreams which are nothing but futile manifestations of the erratic activities of certain mental faculties, which associate ideas, conversations and memories that come together at random. Such dreams are already more significant, for these erratic activities reveal to us the confusion that prevails in our mental being as soon as it is no longer subject to the control of our will, and show us that this being is still not organised or ordered within us, that it is not mature enough to have an autonomous life."
    },
    {
        "question": "How is it better to go to bed early and to get up early?",
        "answer": "When the sun sets, a kind of peace descends upon the earth and this peace is helpful for sleep. When the sun rises, a vigorous energy descends upon the earth and this energy is helpful for work. When you go to bed late and get up late, you contradict the forces of Nature and that is not very wise."

    {
        "question": "What does it mean by \u201cSpiritual Experience?\u201d Do we have to aspire for it?",
        "answer": "It is something which puts you in contact with a consciousness higher than the one you usually have. You have a certain feeling about yourself, you are not even aware of it, it is for you your ordinary condition, you understand. Well, if suddenly you become conscious within of something very different and much higher, then, whatever it may be, this will be a spiritual experience. You may formulate it with a mental idea, you may not formulate it; you may explain it to yourself, you may not; it may last, it may not, it may be instantaneous. But when there is this essential difference in the consciousness and when, naturally, the quality that comes is very\u2026 much higher, clearer, purer than what one usually has, then one can call this a spiritual experience; this means that there are thousands of different things which can be called spiritual experiences."
    },
    {
        "question": "Should we aspire to have a spiritual experience?",
        "answer": "I think it is wiser to aspire to make progress or to be more conscious or to be better or do better than aspire for a spiritual experience; because that might open the door to more or less imaginary and falsified experiences, to movements of the vital which take on the appearance of higher things. One may deceive oneself by having an aspiration for experiences. In fact, the experience must come spontaneously, as the result of inner progress, but not for itself or in itself."
    },
    {
        "question": "How to get answers to our questions from spiritual literature?",
        "answer": "Everybody can do it. It is done in this way: you concentrate. Now, it depends on what you want. If you have an inner problem and want the solution, you concentrate on this problem; if you want to know the condition you are in, which you are not aware of\u2015if you want to get some light on the state you are in, you just come forward with simplicity and ask for the light. Or else, quite simply, if you are curious to know what the invisible knowledge has to tell you, you remain silent and still for a moment and then open the book. I always used to recommend taking a paper-knife, because it is thinner; while you are concentrated you insert it in the book and with the tip indicate something. Then, if you know how to concentrate, that is to say, if you really do it with an aspiration to have an answer, it always comes."

    {
        "question": "What is the significance of books of revelation according to the text?",
        "answer": "In books of this kind (Mother shows \u201cThe Synthesis of Yoga\u201d), books of revelation, there is always an accumulation of forces\u2015at least of higher mental forces, and most often of spiritual forces of the highest knowledge. Every book, on account of the words it contains, is like a small accumulator of these forces."
    },
    {
        "question": "How does one connect with the spiritual forces in a book?",
        "answer": "When you are sincere and have an aspiration, you emanate a certain vibration, the vibration of your aspiration which goes and meets the corresponding force in the book, and it is a higher consciousness which gives you the answer."

        "question": "What example is given to explain the concept of potentiality in a book?",
        "answer": "When people want to practise magic, if they have a bit of nail or hair, it is enough for them, because within this, potentially, there is all that is in the being itself. And in a book there is potentially\u2015not expressed, not manifest\u2015the knowledge which is in the person who wrote the book."

        "answer": "If you concentrate on the book, you can, through the book, go back to the source. And even, by passing through the book, you will be able to receive much more than what is just in the book."
    },
    {
        "question": "What determines the value of the answer received from a book?",
        "answer": "The value of the answer depends on the value of the spiritual force contained in the book."

    {
        "question": "What types of books are more effective for receiving answers?",
        "answer": "Certain books are like this, more powerfully charged than others; there are others where the result is less clear. But generally, books containing aphorisms and short sentences\u2015not very long philosophical explanations, but rather things in a condensed and precise form\u2015it is with these that one succeeds best."

    {
        "question": "When can one say that one has truly entered the spiritual path?",
        "answer": "The first sign is that everything else appears to you absolutely without importance. Your entire life, all your activities, all your movements continue, but they all seem to you utterly unimportant. There may be another sign, such as the feeling that everything is different, of living differently, of a light in the mind which was not there before, of a peace in the heart which was not there before. However, the positive change usually comes later."
    },
    {
        "question": "How can we find the Divine who is hidden in us?",
        "answer": "The first thing is to want it, and know precisely that this comes first, before all other things. If it is the important thing, the only thing that matters, and if everything else comes afterwards, and you want nothing but this, then this is the first condition."

        "question": "Why should I take up the spiritual path? Is it for a personal gain, even if it is high and spiritual? Is it for serving the society and humanity? Is it for the sake of the Divine?",

    },
    {
        "question": "But why do we do this divine Work? Is it to make ourselves...?",

    },
    {
        "question": "What should count in our spiritual pursuits?",

    {
        "question": "What is the danger of personal desires in spiritual pursuits?",
        "answer": "So long as a personal aspiration or desire, a selfish will, get mingled in it, it always creates a mixture and is not exactly an expression of the divine Will."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the ideal attitude in spiritual life?",

        "question": "What is the place of personal effort and discipline in the path of surrender?",
        "answer": "A distinction must be made between a method of development or discipline and a willed action. Discipline is different; I am speaking of willed action. If you surrender you have to give up effort, but that does not mean that you have to abandon also all willed action. On the contrary, you can hasten the realisation by lending your will to the Divine Will. That too is surrender in another form. What is required of you is not a passive surrender, in which you become like a block, but to put your will at the disposal of the Divine Will."
    },
    {
        "question": "What are the steps towards an entire self-offering and surrender to the Divine?",
        "answer": "Surrender is the decision taken to hand over the responsibility of your life to the Divine. Without this decision nothing is at all possible; if you do not surrender, the Yoga is entirely out of the question. Everything else comes naturally after it, for the whole process starts with surrender. You can surrender either through knowledge or through devotion. You may have a strong intuition that the Divine alone is the truth and a luminous conviction that without the Divine you cannot manage. Or you may have a spontaneous feeling that this line is the only way of being happy, a strong psychic desire to belong exclusively to the Divine: \u201cI do not belong to myself,\u201d you say, and give up the responsibility of your being to the Truth. Then comes self-offering: \u201cHere I am, a creature of various qualities, good and bad, dark and enlightened. I offer myself as I am to you, take me up with all my ups and downs, conflicting impulses and tendencies\u2014do whatever you like with me.\u201d In the course of your self-offering, you start unifying your being around what has taken the first decision\u2014the central psychic will. All the jarring elements of your nature have to be harmonised, they have to be taken up one after another and unified with the central being. You may offer yourself to the Divine with a spontaneous movement, but it is not possible to give yourself effectively without this unification. The more you are unified, the more you are able to realise self-giving. And once the self-giving is complete, consecration follows: it is the crown of the whole process of realisation, the last step of the gradation, after which there is no more trouble and everything runs smoothly. But you must not forget that you cannot become integrally consecrated at once. You are often deluded into such a belief when, for a day or two, you have a strong movement of a particular kind. You are led to hope that everything else will automatically follow in its wake; but in fact if you become the least bit self-complacent you retard your own advance. For your being is full of innumerable tendencies at war with one another\u2014almost different personalities, we may say. When one of them gives itself to the Divine, the others come up and refuse their allegiance. \u201cWe have not given ourselves,\u201d they cry, and start clamouring for their independence and expression. Then you bid them be quiet and show them the Truth. Patiently you have to go round your whole being, exploring each nook and corner, facing all those anarchic elements in you which are waiting for their psychological moment to come up. And it is only when you have made the entire round of your mental, vital and physical nature, persuaded everything to give itself to the Divine and thus achieved an absolute unified consecration that you put an end to your difficulties. Then indeed yours is a glorious walk towards transformation, for you no longer go from darkness to knowledge but from knowledge to knowledge, light to light, happiness to happiness\u2026. The complete consecration is undoubtedly not an easy matter, and it might take an almost indefinitely long time if you had to do it all by yourself, by your own independent effort. But when the Divine\u2019s Grace is with you it is not exactly like that. With a little push from the Divine now and then, a little push in this direction and in that, the work becomes comparatively quite easy. Of course the length of time depends on each individual, but it can be very much shortened if you make a really firm resolve. Resolution is the one thing required\u2014resolution is the master-key."

        "question": "What are the two inner aspects of the Disciple for transforming Our Consciousness?",
        "answer": "There should be two parallel movements in the evolution of an individual; and it is because he generally neglects one or the other of these movements in order to concentrate on one alone, that his progress is so halting and so unbalanced. One of these movements is to become conscious of all the constituent elements of the being, material and sensory as well as intellectual and spiritual; we must become acquainted with the mechanism of the life within us, with all its tendencies, qualities, faculties and varied activities, very impartially, that is, without any preconceived idea of good or evil, without any absolute or arbitrary judgment (for our judgments are inevitably lacking in clear-sightedness) about what should subsist and what should disappear, what should be encouraged and what should be suppressed. Our vision of what we are must be objective, without bias, if we want it to be sincere and integral: we are faced with a universe which we must explore down to its smallest details, know in its most obscure and infinitesimal elements, with a scientific attitude of perfect mental impersonality, that is, without any a priori judgments. Whatever we may think, this work of observation, analysis and introspection is never completed. At all events, as long as we are on earth in a physical body, we should always study the immensely complex being that we are, so that no element may elude our knowledge and therefore our control: for we can only master what we know and command what we have mastered. This brings us to the second movement which should exist parallel to and simultaneous with the first. It is the consecration, the constant and constantly repeated surrender of all the elements subject to our control to the Supreme and Divine Law. Each element that has become conscious of itself, each tendency, each faculty, must surrender to the Sovereign Guidance of the Eternal Essence of Being, with the simple trust of a child; She will order, classify and utilise all these elements in the right way; She and She alone can separate what can be used from what cannot, what must be encouraged from what must be eliminated; and, no doubt, as before Her all is of equal value, all can be used, since by Her all is transformed, illumined, transfigured: all that becomes conscious of Her and gives itself to Her becomes Herself and thus escapes all notions of good and evil, which are purely external and human. One of these movements, one of these attitudes without the other is incomplete and one-sided. To consecrate our being in one block to the Supreme Essence is not enough: all the elements that we do not know and have not mastered elude this consecration and therefore follow their own law instead of conforming to the Eternal Law, and become the source of every disturbance, every unexpected revolt in one who had yet thought himself to be entirely a servant of The Law. But he was forgetful of all the unknown nooks in his being which also have a claim to life and activity and which are manifested in their turn, but in an activity that is disorderly and disharmonious relative to the being as a whole, since they elude the central will. On the other hand, to become conscious of ourselves in our smallest details is vain and sterile, even dangerous, if it is not done for the sake of order, so that the Divine Essence can be made the Omnipotent ruler of all these elements, if we do not secure their unreserved surrender to Her supreme guidance, to The Sovereign Law. Only in the balanced union of these two attitudes can one truly, integrally, call oneself a Servant of the Eternal."

        "answer": "The Truth cannot be expressed in mental terms. It cannot be formulated or defined\u2014it is to be lived. One who is wholly consecrated to the Truth will know at each moment what must be done through a kind of intuition or revelation."

    {
        "question": "If Truth is One and Universal, why is there so much quarrel and conflict among religions, sects, and ideologies on the nature of truth?",
        "answer": "The dogmas of sects and the intolerance of religions arise from the belief that their own beliefs are the only knowledge, condemning others as error or ignorance. This leads to establishing their beliefs as dogma and violently opposing differing views."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is this truth of the being, and how is it expressed externally in physical life?",
        "answer": "Each individual being has a direct and unique relation with the Supreme, which must be expressed in one\u2019s life. This relation is unique and exclusive, meaning that no two are the same, and each person is indispensable in creation."

        "answer": "Generally, it is believed that things end badly in Nature, but in truth, the movements of Nature are progressive, even if they appear to recede at times. Withdrawals are merely appearances, as they are necessary for greater advances."
    },
    {
        "question": "How to deal with unpleasant thoughts?",
        "answer": "There are several methods. Generally\u2014but it depends on people\u2014generally, the easiest way is to think of something else. That is, to concentrate one\u2019s attention upon something that has nothing to do with that thought has no connection with that thought, like reading or some work\u2014generally something creative, some creative work. For instance, those who write, while they are writing (let us take simply a novelist), while he is writing, all other thoughts are gone, for he is concentrated on what he is doing. When he finishes writing, if he has no control, the other thoughts will return. But precisely when one is attacked by a thought, one can try to do some creative work; for example, the scientist could do some research work, a special study to discover something, something that is very absorbing; that is the easiest way. Naturally, those who have begun to control their thought can make a movement of rejection; push aside the thought as one would a physical object. But that is more difficult and asks for a much greater mastery. If one can manage it, it is more active, in the sense that if you reject that movement, that thought, if you chase it off effectively and constantly or almost repeatedly, finally it does not come any more. But in the other case, it can always return. That makes two methods. The third means is to be able to bring down a sufficiently great light from above which will be the \u201cdenial\u201d in the deeper sense; that is, if the thought which comes is something dark (and especially if it comes from the subconscient or inconscient and is sustained by instinct), if one can bring down from above the light of a true knowledge, a higher power, and put that light upon the thought, one can manage to dissolve it or enlighten or transform it\u2014this is the supreme method. This is still a little more difficult. But it can be done, and if one does it, one is cured\u2014not only does the thought not come back but the very cause is removed. The first step is to think of something else (but in this way, you know, it will be indefinitely repeated); the second is to fight; and the third is to transform. When one has reached the third step, not only is one cured but one has made a permanent progress."

        "answer": "The human individual is a very complex being composed of innumerable elements, each one of which is an independent entity and has almost a personality.

If one is pulled by absolutely opposite tendencies, if one spends three-fourths of his life without being conscious of himself and the reasons why he does things, is one a real being? One does not exist. One is a mass of influences, movements, forces, actions, reactions, but one is not a being. One begins to become a being when he begins to have a will. And one can\u2019t have a will unless he is unified. And when you have a will, you will be able to say, say to the Divine: \u201cI want what You want.\u201d But not before that.

        "answer": "He must find his own place, the place which he alone can occupy in the general concert, and he must give himself entirely to it, not forgetting that he is playing only one note in the terrestrial symphony and yet his note is indispensable to the harmony of the whole."

        "question": "What are the two approaches to Yoga?",
        "answer": "There are two paths of Yoga, one of tapasy\u0101 (discipline), and the other of surrender. The path of tapasy\u0101 is arduous. Here you rely solely upon yourself, you proceed by your own strength. You ascend and achieve according to the measure of your force. There is always the danger of falling down. And once you fall, you lie broken in the abyss and there is hardly a remedy. The other path, the path of surrender, is safe and sure. It is here, however, that the Western people find their difficulty. They have been taught to fear and avoid all that threatens their personal independence. They have imbibed with their mothers\u2019 milk the sense of individuality. And surrender means giving up all that. In other words, you may follow, as Ramakrishna says, either the path of the baby monkey or that of the baby cat. The baby monkey holds to its mother in order to be carried about and it must hold firm, otherwise if it loses its grip, it falls. On the other hand, the baby cat does not hold to its mother, but is held by the mother and has no fear nor responsibility; it has nothing to do but to let the mother hold it and cry ma ma."

    {
        "question": "How to awaken the Yoga shakthi?",
        "answer": "I think it awakens quite naturally the moment one takes the resolution to do the yoga. If the resolution is sincere and one has an aspiration, it wakes up by itself. In fact, it is perhaps its awakening which gives the aspiration to do yoga. It is possible that it is a result of the Grace\u2026 or after some conversation or reading, something that has suddenly given you the idea and aspiration to know what yoga is and to practise it. Sometimes just a simple conversation with someone is enough or a passage one reads from a book; well, it awakens this Yoga-Shakti and it is this which makes you do your yoga. One is not aware of it at first\u2014except that something has changed in our life, a new decision is taken, a turning."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is it, this Yoga-Shakti, Sweet Mother?",
        "answer": "It is the energy of progress. It is the energy which makes you do the yoga, precisely, makes you progress\u2014consciously. It is a conscious energy. In fact, the Yoga-Shakti is the power to do yoga."
