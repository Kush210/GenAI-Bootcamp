Including both basic usage and advanced customization options caters to a wide range of users, from beginners to advanced practitioners.\n",
            "CLI Functionality for Creating New Crews (create_crew.py):\n",
            "Structure: The CLI script is structured logically, with a main function that orchestrates the creation process and auxiliary functions that handle specific tasks such as copying template files. The separation of concerns is evident in the modular approach to handling different parts of the crew creation process.\n",
            "Quality: The script demonstrates good coding practices:\n",
            "Use of external libraries like click to simplify CLI development.\n",
            "Clear feedback to users through informative messages.\n",
            "Consideration for idempotency by checking if folders exist before attempting creation.\n",
            "Areas for improvement include:\n",
            " - Error handling could be more robust, especially in scenarios where file operations might fail due to permissions or other unforeseen issues.\n",
            " - Some parts of the code could benefit from further abstraction or refactoring to enhance readability and maintainability.\n",
            "Conclusion\n",
            "Overall, the structure and quality of the source code are commendable. The project adheres to many best practices in software development, resulting in code that is both functional and maintainable.
